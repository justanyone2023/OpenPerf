# Open Source Project Recommendation Based on Link Prediction

### Research Background
Open source software development encourages global developers to participate in development tasks such as bug fixing, code testing, and documentation improvements in an open collaborative manner. Each developer has their unique project needs and technical background. Failing to match them with appropriate open source projects may hinder the smooth progress of development tasks and adversely affect the development of open source projects and even the entire open source ecosystem.

### Task Description
How can we recommend open source projects of interest to developers and community operators based on relationships between projects? Recommending open source projects of interest can help developers comprehensively understand projects in their target technology areas, reducing the waste of development resources.

### Task Challenges
Complex project relationships: The relationships between open source projects are complex and variable, and developers and community operators often need to invest a lot of time and effort to understand and master these relationships. How to accurately use these relationships for efficient open source project recommendation is a significant challenge.
Project diversity: There is a great deal of diversity in open source projects in terms of technology areas, development needs, and participant backgrounds, which increases the complexity of recommendation systems.
Limitations of keyword search and tag matching: Although platforms like GitHub provide features based on keyword search and tag matching, the quality of the results from these methods is uneven and cannot fully meet users' needs. How to provide a more effective method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of finding open source projects is a problem that needs to be addressed.
