# Open Source Community Sentiment Classification

### Research Background
Sentiment analysis tasks based on comments in the open source domain are relatively less common compared to popular fields like restaurants and e-commerce. Developers' emotions can affect the quality of work, productivity, creativity, team harmony, and job satisfaction. Sentiment analysis of comments can reveal developers' behaviors and insights on specific aspects of projects, which is beneficial for the healthy development of projects and aims to improve developers' work efficiency.

### Task Description
Most comments on GitHub are neutral. How can we mine comments containing developers' opinions from a massive amount of text? Different types of comments express different viewpoints, and developers also express opinions on various aspects of the open source community. How to obtain fine-grained developer emotions is also a challenge of this task.

### Task Challenges
Diversity of sentiments: Common sentiment classification tasks primarily focus on binary or ternary classifications. In GitHub, some developers' emotions are relatively complex, such as optimism, disgust, anger, agreement, questioning, etc. Fine-grained analysis can uncover more valuable opinion information.

Diversity of evaluation objects: Developers often discuss specific aspects of open source projects, such as code refactoring, code style, security, document readability, etc. How to obtain comments on different aspects for sentiment analysis is also one of the challenges.
