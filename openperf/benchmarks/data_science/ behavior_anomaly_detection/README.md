# Open Source Community Behavior Anomaly Detection

### Research Background
Developer behavior data in open source projects is an important information resource that can be used to monitor project dynamics, promptly detect and handle anomalous behavior during the project process, and optimize project management systems. As the number of project participants increases, manually monitoring all anomalous behaviors becomes impractical, necessitating a rapid and efficient automated anomaly monitoring solution.

### Task Description
How to design and implement a real-time anomaly detection framework that conducts anomaly detection on massive streams of real-time collected developer behavior data, achieving the following objectives: providing early warnings for abnormal events like those in NPM libraries, timely feedback to community managers for adjusting project management systems; reducing the computational scale and time consumption of the algorithm, reducing infrastructure requirements; filtering out anomalous behavior data, facilitating other fine-grained studies on the data later on.
### Task Challenges
High Generalizability: Open source projects vary widely, and the behavior data from different projects have different distributions and statistical characteristics, hence the designed detection model needs to be highly generalizable to different projects.
Computational Efficiency: To achieve real-time anomaly detection, it is necessary to reduce the time complexity and computational scale of the algorithm, and lower the space complexity, meaning effective compression and filtering of continuously arriving massive behavior data is needed to reduce computational scale.
Detection Accuracy: While ensuring real-time detection, it is crucial to ensure the high detection accuracy of the scheme.
