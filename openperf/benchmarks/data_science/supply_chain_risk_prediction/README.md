# Open Source Software Supply Chain Risk Prediction

### Research Background
Open source software, as a cornerstone of information technology innovation, is characterized by increasing complexity and scale in its dependencies, which brings exponential growth in security issues. These problems can have a domino effect within the open source software supply chain, affecting all systems that rely on it. Currently, the global demand for open source components is growing rapidly, but the security of the open source software supply chain continues to deteriorate. At the same time, the security of the open source software supply chain, as a means of national strategy and a foundation for enterprise operations, is highly prioritized.

### Task Description
How can a model be designed and implemented to predict and manage risks in the open source software supply chain? To achieve this goal, it is necessary to understand and quantify various risks in the software supply chain, including internal attributes of the software (such as the number of code lines, underlying software design, security vulnerabilities, etc.) and external attributes (such as development team, activity level, popularity, etc.). A predictive model that can quantitatively assess these risks needs to be designed and implemented to help businesses and organizations better manage their supply chains.

### Task Challenges
Design and optimization of the prediction model: Designing and optimizing an effective prediction model can be very complex due to the need to handle a large number of features and consider various factors that might affect the risk.
Assessing the accuracy and usability of prediction results: A system needs to be designed to comprehensively evaluate the results of the predictive model, including its accuracy, stability, and practicality.
Predicting and managing risks in the early development process: Assessing and managing the maintainability of software in the early stages can help development teams and users identify problems with the software early on, allowing them to take preventive and corrective measures, thus significantly reducing the costs of later use and maintenance. However, how to effectively predict and manage risks in the early stages is a challenging issue.
