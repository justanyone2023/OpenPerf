This is primarily used for bot user agents, since we wouldn't have been able to provide a proper redirect status code (since it occurred after the initial response was sent).\r\n\r\nHowever, the router would trigger a SPA navigation, while the `<meta>` tag lagged to perform an MPA navigation, resulting in 2 navigations to the same URL.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nWhen the client side code attempts to handle the redirect, we treat it like an MPA navigation. This will suspend in render and trigger a `location.push`/`location.replace` to the targeted URL.

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen calling `revalidatePath` or `revalidateTag` in a server action for an intercepted route with dynamic segments, the page would do a full browser refresh.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWhen constructing rewrites for interception routes, the route params leading up to the interception route are \"voided\" with a `__NEXT_EMPTY_PARAM__` demarcation. When it comes time to look up the values for these dynamic segments, since the params aren't going to be part of the URL, they get matched via `FlightRouterState` ([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/d67d658ce7396c4b6be1b724be5f45763d5a1803/packages/next/src/server/app-render/app-render.tsx#L153-L201)). \r\n\r\nThe `shouldProvideFlightRouterState` variable only passes it through for RSC requests; however, since the server action will perform the action & return the flight data in a single pass, that means the updated tree from the server action isn't going to receive the `FlightRouterState` when constructing the new tree. This means the old tree will have a `[\"locale\", \"en\", \"d\"]` segment, and the new tree from the server action will have `\"[locale]\"`. When the router detects this kind of segment mismatch, it assumes the user navigated to a new root layout, and triggers an MPA navigation. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis unconditionally provides the `FlightRouterState` to `makeGetDynamicParamFromSegment` so that it can properly extract dynamic params for interception routes. We currently enforce interception routes to be dynamic due to this `FlightRouterState` dependency.\r\n\r\nFixes #59796\r\nCloses NEXT-2079\r\n",

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen a parallel segment in the current router tree is no longer \"active\" during a soft navigation (ie, no longer matches a page component on the particular route), it remains on-screen until the page is refreshed, at which point it would switch to rendering the `default.tsx` component. However, when revalidating the router cache via `router.refresh`, or when a server action finishes & refreshes the router cache, this would trigger the \"hard refresh\" behavior. This would have the unintended consequence of a 404 being triggered (which is the default behavior of `default.tsx`) or inactive segments disappearing unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWhen the router cache is refreshed, it currently fetches new data for the page by fetching from the current URL the user is on. This means that the server will never respond with the data it needs if the segment wasn't \"activated\" via the URL we're fetching from, as it came from someplace else. Instead, the server will give us data for the `default.tsx` component, which we don't want to render when doing a soft refresh. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis updates the `FlightRouterState` to encode information about the URL that caused the segment to become  active. That way, when some sort of revalidation event takes place, we can both refresh the data for the current URL (existing handling), and recursively refetch segment data for anything that was still present in the tree but requires fetching from a different URL. We patch this new data into the tree before committing the final `CacheNode` to the router. \r\n\r\n**Note**: I re-used the existing `refresh` and `url` arguments in `FlightRouterState` to avoid introducing more options to this data structure that is already a bit tricky to work with. Initially I was going to re-use `\"refetch\"` as-is, which seemed to work ok, but I'm worried about potential implications of this considering they have different semantics. In an abundance of caution, I added a new marker type (\"`refresh`\", alternative suggestions welcome).\r\n\r\nThis has some trade-offs: namely, if there are a lot of different segments that are in this stale state that require data from different URLs, the refresh is going to be blocked while we fetch all of these segments. Having to do a separate round-trip for each of these segments could be expensive. In an ideal world, we'd be able to enumerate the segments we'd want to refetch and where they came from, so it could be handled in a single round-trip. There are some ideas on how to improve per-segment fetching which are out of scope of this PR.

(More details in this #59585)\r\n\r\nThis was a stop-gap and not an ideal solution, as this behavior means `router.refresh()` would effectively behave like reloading the page, where \"stale\" segments (ones that went from `__PAGE__` -> `__DEFAULT__`) would disappear.\r\n\r\nFixes #60815\r\nFixes #60950\r\nFixes #51711\r\nFixes #51714\r\nFixes #58715\r\nFixes #60948\r\nFixes #62213\r\nFixes #61341\r\n\r\nCloses [NEXT-1845](https://linear.app/vercel/issue/NEXT-1845)\r\nCloses [NEXT-2030](https://linear.app/vercel/issue/NEXT-2030)\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

and those are single runs - but from first \"require time dump\" you can estimate importing Telemetry (that might be unused) is costing 149ms / 658ms ~= 22.5% of entire time spent on importing modules - that's pretty significant\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nBy moving static import/require from top level to conditional code path that actually uses it. This code path already have some modules lazy/conditionally loaded. `packages/next/src/telemetry/storage.ts` doesn't seem to have import side effects so at least on my first glance it doesn't seem like moving import should cause problems?\r\n\r\n",

To convert one more file to ESM\r\n2. To use the modern format\r\n3. To follow other similar migrations that have taken place in the Next.js codebase (eg. `next.config.mjs`)\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n- Change file extensions from `.cjs` to `.mjs` (change similar to PR #58380)\r\n- Change module format from CommonJS to ESM\r\n- Add type for the config, for users who enable `checkJs: true` in `tsconfig.json`\r\n",

    "description": "## History\r\n\r\nPreviously, we added support for `squoosh` because it was a wasm implementation that \"just worked\" on all platforms when running `next dev` for the first time. However, it was slow so we always recommended manually installing `sharp` for production use cases running `next build` and `next start`. \r\n\r\nNow that [`sharp` supports webassembly](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#webassembly), we no longer need to maintain `squoosh`, so it can be removed. We also don't need to make the user install sharp manually because it can be installed under `optionalDependencies`. I left it optional in case there was some platform that still needed to manually install the wasm variant with `npm install --cpu=wasm32 sharp` such as codesandbox/stackblitz (I don't believe sharp has any fallback built in yet).\r\n\r\nSince we can guarantee `sharp`, we can also remove `get-orientation` dep and upgrade `image-size` dep.\r\n\r\nI also moved an [existing `sharp` test](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/56674) into its own fixture since it was unrelated to image optimization.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/41417\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/54670\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/54708\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/44804\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48820\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61810\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61696\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/44685\r\n- Closes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64362\r\n- See also [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/14mvsll/the_sharp_package_for_image_optimization_is_a/)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change because newer versions of `sharp` no longer support `yarn@1`.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/3750\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to install with `yarn --ignore-engines` flag.\r\n\r\nAlso note that Vercel no longer defaults to yarn when no lockfile is found\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/11131\r\n- https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/11242\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2823",

    "description": "### What\r\nActions that revalidate the router state by kicking off a refetch (such as `router.refresh()` or dev fast refresh) would incorrectly trigger an interception route if one matched the current URL, or in the case of already being on an intercepted route, would trigger the full detail page instead.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nInterception rewrites use the `nextUrl` header to determine if the requested path should be rewritten to a different path. We currently forward that header indiscriminately, which means that if you were on a non-intercepted route and called `router.refresh()`, the UI would change to the intercepted content instead (since it would treat it the same as a soft-navigation).\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis updates various reducers to only forward the `nextUrl` header if there's an interception route present in the tree. If there is, we want to refresh its data, rather than the data for the underlying page. The reverse is also true: if we were on the \"full\" page, and triggered a `router.refresh()`, we won't forward `nextUrl` meaning it won't fetch the interception data. \r\n\r\nIn order to determine if an interception route is present in the tree, I had to add a new segment type for dynamic interception routes, as by the time they reach the client they are stripped of their interception marker.\r\n\r\n**Note: There are a series of bugs related to `router.refresh` with parallel/interception routes, such as the previous page/slot content disappearing when triggering a refresh. This does not address all of those cases, but I'm working through them!**\r\n\r\nFixes #60844\r\nFixes #62470\r\nCloses NEXT-2737\r\n",

    "title": "Fix instant loading states after invalidating prefetch cache",
    "description": "In #61573, I updated the navigation reducer to request a new prefetch entry if it's stale. But this has the unintended consequence of making instant loading states effectively useless after 30s (when the prefetch would have expired). Blocking navigation and then rendering the loading state isn't ideal - if we have some loading data in a cache node, we should re-use it.\r\n\r\nNow that #62346 stores loading data in the `CacheNode`, we can copy over `loading` during a navigation.\r\n\r\nThis PR repurposes `fillCacheWithDataProperty` which wasn't being used anywhere, to instead be a utility we can use to programmatically trigger a lazy fetch on a particular segment path by nulling out it's data while copying over other properties. We could have used the existing util as-is, but ideally we only have a single spot where lazy fetching can happen, which currently is in `LayoutRouter`.\r\n\r\nWhen a stale prefetch entry is detected, rather than applying the data to the tree, this PR will copy over the `loading` nodes and will \"delete\" the data so it can be refetched.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

The one that doesn't specify `force-static` is correctly omitted from the prerender manifest. The one that is `force-static` is correctly in the prerender manifest with the right expiration time.

This is a problem because yesterday that return type was changed: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/commit/bf659aefa780a8b61b1636bd0296e0723c96d780#diff-1d64e275d9755825ba[‚Ä¶]520436dbd8e1f1fd9fc66a9 and that change also removes one of the previous types that the `.d.ts` in Next.js automatically included.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `render()` return type to be explicit instead of inferred, this makes sure that the `.d.ts` file includes only `: React.ReactNode` instead of the many types of return values allowed.\r\n\r\nThe reason I went with the explicit type instead of e.g. upgrading `@types/react` is that upgrading the types would cause existing applications that use older versions of `@types/react` would break.

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen triggering an MPA navigation (also commonly referred to as a \"hard navigation\"), and then restoring the previous page via the browser's bfcache, subsequent requests to the same link wouldn't navigate until reloading the page or performing a different navigation.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nMPA navigations in app router are handled in a fairly subtle way: the router state is updated with an indication that an external URL was clicked, and once the router sees the pending navigation, it kicks off a `location.replace` or `location.push` with the specified URL **in render**. The router then suspends indefinitely to prevent committing the render. However, the router will only make the `replace`/`push` request if there's not already a pending navigation to that same URL. \r\n\r\nThe pending check is needed to avoid continuously calling `push`/`replace` when unrelated router state changes occur (for example, if I hover over a link and trigger a prefetch action and the router re-renders, it shouldn't make another `location.push` call to the same URL that's pending)\r\n\r\nHowever, the source of the bug is that the variable that holds this pending state is also restored by the browser's cache, since it takes a snapshot prior to exiting the page. This means that when clicking the browser back button, `pendingMpaPath` would still be set to the URL we just came from. When clicking the link again, it would see that the requested URL is the same as the pending URL, and not perform any history actions.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis clears the pending value when the router is restored from bfcache.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

We tell overlay that there're missing tags through props, let it handle everything inside.\r\n\r\nIt can also hmr once you fix the error. One drawback is that when you re-introduce the error, it might trigger react DOM updates exception (`Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.`) instead of the \"missing tags\" message again. Besides that the HMR works properly.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2741",

(Default 30 seconds)\r\n- `static` is the value that is used when the `prefetch` `Link` prop is `true`. (Default 5 minutes)\r\n\r\nAdditional details:\r\n- Loading boundaries are considered reusable for the time period indicated by the `static` property (default 5 minutes)\r\n- This doesn't disable partial rendering support, **meaning shared layouts won't automatically be refetched every navigation, only the new segment data**.\r\n- This also doesn't change back/forward caching behavior to ensure things like scroll restoration etc still work nicely.\r\n\r\nPlease see the original proposal [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/54075#discussioncomment-6754339) for more information. The primary difference is that this is a global configuration, rather than a per-segment configuration, and it isn't applied to layouts.

Currently, we already have compiler check so this will already error:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use server'\r\n\r\nexport function foo () {} // missing async\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since exported values can be very dynamic the compiler can't catch all mistakes like that. We also have a runtime check for all exports in a `'use server'` function, but it only covers `typeof value === 'function'`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a stricter check for \"use server\" annotated values to also make sure they're async functions (`value.constructor.name === 'AsyncFunction'`).\r\n\r\nThat said, there are still cases like synchronously returning a promise to make a function \"async\", but it's still very different by definition. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst f = async () => { throw 1; return 1 }\r\nconst g = () => { throw 1; return Promise.resolve(1) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `g()` can be synchronously caught (`try { g() } catch {}`) but `f()` can't even if they have the same types. If we allow `g` to be a Server Action, this behavior is no longer always true but depending on where it's called (server or client).\r\n\r\nCloses #62727.",

On initial load, if the HTML is broken, a fix will correctly make the overlay go away, however, a later edit to the root layout won't make the overlay re-appear. We can either do a full page reload when the root layout is edited, or we might need a different way to detect the broken HTML when only RSC payloads are sent. We can look into that in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2396",

So we switched to the path of leveraging component stack and mismatch contents.\r\nReact reordering the tags after hydration. For instance the `script` or `link` tags could be hoist by React Float, so the lines of html is are to preserved. so the diff is hard to be super accurate unless your mismatch is small. If you're mismatch a component with rich html content, it could be a pretty large diff.\r\n\r\nAnother case is if you have a bad nesting html like `<p> ...<span>... <p>my text</p> ...</span>... <p>` where there're many span in between, the final different could also be hudge as browser will close the first `<p>` tag and the rest content will go into the diff. Hence we're going with the component and text content diff.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2645",

    "description": "### What\r\n\r\nWhen you have bad nesting html in your React code, React wil raise hydration error since the browser html parser might parse it to sth else different comparing to server html on client. Previously we're display only the warning in the error description in dev overlay.\r\n\r\nNow we introduced another format of displaying pesudo html that representing your code, with highlighting the html tag that causes the error. Since React might gives you the whole component stack of React tree, so we also introduced a way that can collapse the error.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/4800338/622122d6-4d2e-4c8e-95e8-4864343e478b\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nThe reason we added this is that even we show the html diff, it could super large due to React ordering the html on client, so the mismatch might be a lot. The idea here is similar to what you saw when you passed down a bad event handler into server component, we displayed a pesudo html as it could hit your mind faster than just seeing the warning. The best way is to display the source code, but before we can show the source, getting component stack display as pseudo html instead of here could be more helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After vs Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/4800338/714119ad-ff23-46a9-bc5a-5601eb390e71\">\r\n<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/4800338/575f95fa-889e-4cee-ad19-9c2fea06519a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2621",

This export excludes those APIs working with React context which are only working in client components. \r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nWe fixed an issue bad alias for react-server condition of react itself in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61522/files#diff-ecb951c8d26893f6d1e4425a873b399d52346ef63eb90fba79d980cef2fabe8cL35 , this was a good fix. But we found that if you're using edge runtime with `next/navigation` it will error with bundling that you're attempted to import some client component hooks such as `useContext` from react.\r\n\r\nSo we introduced a `react-server` version of `next/navigation` that doesn't interoplate with any client hooks, can we'll bundle that one instead of original `next/navigation` when you're using it in server components or app routes.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2583\r\nCloses NEXT-2519\r\nFixes #62187",

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen the popstate action is fired (as is the case in a browser back button), if the page you're going back to has missing cache node data, the router will crash.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nAlmost all router actions will suspend at the app-router level with the exception of `ACTION_RESTORE`. This was to address an issue where suspending in the router would add enough delay for browser scroll restoration behavior not to work. \r\n\r\nAs a result, when going back to the page with missing data, app-router wouldn't suspend but layout-router would suspend on the missing data while triggering a lazy fetch. We trigger a server-patch with the applied lazy data, but when React replays the render, it will replay the branch without the cache node data applied. This results in the router getting caught in a loop of suspending, applying the cache node, replaying the branch without the cache node, and eventually crashing due to an error thrown by React to prevent re-suspending indefinitely.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis adds a property to the cache node to signal if the lazy data has been resolved. If it has been, we won't call the server patch action again. \r\n\r\nFixes #61336\r\nCloses NEXT-2438\r\n",

    "description": "### What & Why\r\n\r\nThis PR helps fixes a long time tree-shaking issue that if you're import some identifiers from client components, the whole client component is being included in the client chunk. Because we're using import eager mode in webpack to include all the client component modules that make sure they're present in SSR entry and browser entry when they're transformed to client reference on RSC layer.\r\n\r\nBut the way we collect client components is a bit \"aggressive\" where contains some spaces to optimize.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n\r\nWe change the collected client components from simpliy collecting it resolved module request, into collecting both the imported identifiers (by server components) and the module request. And when we inserted the used client components imports into the SSR and Client entry, leverage webpack magic comments `\"webpackExports\"` to only contain the used exports in the bundle. Thank you webpack for this nice feature : )\r\n\r\nAlong the way we also fixed an issue that when you only used default export, the `default` export itself should also be proxied when the bundle is in ESM.\r\n\r\n#### Notice\r\n\r\nThere's a limitation yet that it can't work with barrel file, if you have a shared component `index.js` to re-export the changes several client components there and you only partially import few from `index.js` it won't work. For the cases that the node_modules package contain a barrel file importing multiple client components, please use [optimizePackageImports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/optimizePackageImports) config for now. We'll have follow up optimizations\r\n\r\n### Testing Result\r\n\r\nIf we compare the `react-aria-components` the reproduction from #60246, you'll see the result being optimized a lot:\r\n\r\n#### After vs Before\r\n\r\n134KB being tree-shaked out ü§Ø \r\n```\r\nRoute (app)                              Size     First Load JS\r\n‚îå ‚óã /                                    324 B           127 kB\r\n‚îú ‚óã /_not-found                          872 B          86.5 kB\r\n‚îî ‚óã /other-page                          174 B           127 kB\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nRoute (app)                              Size     First Load JS\r\n‚îå ‚óã /                                    325 B           261 kB\r\n‚îú ‚óã /_not-found                          870 B          86.5 kB\r\n‚îî ‚óã /other-page                          176 B           261 kB\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #60246\r\nRelated report: https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues/5639\r\nCloses NEXT-2527\r\nphase 1 of NEXT-1799\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Also it should show trailing slash for all pathnames if that config is enabled.\r\n\r\nBTW there's a `__NEXT_TRAILING_SLASH` env but since we're using the fixed nextjs runtime module, so this can't be dynamically replaced in the metadata resolving modules.

This was to prevent the app from crashing in the case where app router internals weren't available in the history state. The original assumption was that this is a rare / unlikely edge case. However the above scenario is a very probable case where this can happen, and triggering an MPA navigation isn't ideal. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis updates `ACTION_RESTORE` to be resilient to an undefined router state tree.

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen a global not found page is rendered, and when the not-found page or containing layout has a link with `prefetch: auto` back to the root page, the router would update the URL but not correctly swap out the not-found component with the page component.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWith auto prefetching (which is the default when `prefetch` is left unspecified on a link), the router will perform a partial prefetch on dynamic pages. This means it'll fetch the flight data _without_ React nodes and store it in the prefetch cache. On navigation, this is used to determine where we already have cached React nodes and where we need to trigger a lazy fetch to get new data. However, global not found pages are peculiar in that they will always contain a data path like: `['', { children: ['__PAGE__', {}] }]` since they are inserted at the root. This means that if there's also a page component that corresponds with the same path, the router will incorrectly think it already has cache node data for it.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nDuring SSR when the `asNotFound` flag signals to the renderer that the component we're rendering is matching the global not-found page, we modify the segment key to be something unique so the data path won't collide with a top-level page.\r\n\r\nIn [fc01c8e](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62033/commits/fc01c8e7f7970253a241f00b2a9879fb35b03276) I added handling only on the server to modify the segment key. This still fixes the issue, but at the cost of triggering an MPA navigation on the client because it's treated as a root layout change\r\n\r\nIn [69d5687](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62033/commits/69d5687765b4ab9dbd974e8db5c6c87a6a3084d4) I added client handling to not treat this special segment key as a root layout change, and to signal to the router it needs to refetch the data. This ensures we don't do an MPA navigation. \r\n\r\nFixes #61956\r\nCloses NEXT-2481\r\n",

    "description": "In `v14.0.2-canary.1` users started noticing more memory errors especially with many edge runtime configured pages. After investigation it seems this can be related to the additional transpiling we configured in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/59569 and https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/57784\r\n\r\nTo help alleviate this we are updating the default swc loader to have an additional check to see if no special features such as `next/font`, `next/dynamic`, or `use server/client` directives are present and then no-oping in the loader to avoid additional overhead for a majority of modules. \r\n\r\nFor monitoring regressions our `stats-app` has been updated with repeated edge-ssr routes to hopefully help us keep an eye on memory or cache size issues. \r\n\r\nx-ref: NEXT-2430\r\nx-ref: NEXT-2395\r\nx-ref: NEXT-2299\r\nx-ref: NEXT-2324\r\nx-ref: NEXT-2373\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2479",

    "description": "We've seen too many instances of folks accidentally committing their `.env` files that I feel it's time to make this change.\r\n\r\nUp until now, Next.js has recommended that you use `.env.local` when working locally to store your environment variables. Some developers do intentionally want to commit their `.env` file without secret values to source control. However, the ecosystem is fragmented on `.local` support.\r\n\r\nThere are tools which require secrets values that do _not_ support `.local` and require using `.env`. This means that it's possible to dump your secret values into a `.env` file and commit to source control, thinking that the defaults would have you covered.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the defaults for `create-next-app` to ignore all `.env` files by default. If you want to commit then, you opt-in by modifying your `.gitignore`, versus the opposite.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://x.com/complexlity/status/1755890800527892716",

This will print the stack trace for the accesses for all Dynamic API's that were called. This includes those API's that were called during the flight render if they were called before the static shell was ready.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nTo take the most advantage of partial prerendering, it's important to track where Dynamic API's are called so developers can determine what has caused part of the component tree not to be included in the static shell. This also helps debug situations where the error thrown by Dynamic API's (used internally for tracking and interruption) are caught but not re-thrown, but due to the implementation of the flight renderer provided by React, we are unable to distinguish between errors that are swallowed by user code or by the flight renderer.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nInstead of using a boolean to track **if** a dynamic API was used, this actually captures the stack at the callsite, allowing developers to find the location in the codebase that invoked it.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2399",

However, a side effect of this process is that it skips the clean-up of the cancelHandler. This leads to router error events being fired erroneously, causing confusion and potential stability issues, as the system behaves as if an error occurred when, in fact, none did.\r\n \r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by modifying the shallow routing logic to also skip the creation of the cancelHandler. Given that shallow routing operations are synchronous and do not involve data fetching or other asynchronous tasks that might need to be canceled, the cancelHandler is unnecessary in this context.\r\n\r\nfixes #61772",

However the RSC data for each segment wouldn't have this same casing logic applied. This is causing the router to not recognize that there is already RSC data available for that segment, resulting in an infinite suspense cycle.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThe `toLowerCase()` logic shouldn't be needed here. Technically we could leave this in place and update `matchSegment` to also apply the lowercase logic, but currently there are too many utility functions that parse segments to comfortably make that change.

However, it was slow so we always recommended manually installing `sharp` for production use cases running `next build` and `next start`. \r\n\r\nNow that [`sharp` supports webassembly](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#webassembly), we no longer need to maintain `squoosh`, so it can be removed. We also don't need to make the user install sharp manually because it can be installed under `optionalDependencies`. I left it optional in case there was some platform that still needed to manually install the wasm variant with `npm install --cpu=wasm32 sharp` such as codesandbox/stackblitz (I don't believe sharp has any fallback built in yet).\r\n\r\nSince we can guarantee `sharp`, we can also remove `get-orientation` dep and upgrade `image-size` dep.\r\n\r\nI also moved an [existing `sharp` test](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/56674) into its own fixture since it was unrelated to image optimization.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/41417\r\n- Closes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/54670\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/54708\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/44804\r\n- Related https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48820",

This calls out to the server and suspends until the data fetch is resolved, and applied to the router tree. However after suspending but before updating the client router, we set `childNode.lazyData` to null. When we unsuspend from the server patch action, `childNode.rsc` might still be missing and clearing `lazyData` means we've blown away the reference to the fetch we already had pending, triggering a refetch loop.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis removes the logic that mutates the cache node in render, as this is not concurrent safe, and doesn't appear to be needed for anything.\r\n\r\nFixes #61117\r\nFixes #61336\r\nCloses NEXT-2361\r\n",

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen navigating to a page that uses a loading boundary + parallel route, an empty white screen would be displayed rather than the loading state / final state\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWith parallel routes, the RSC data is an array of data paths, each corresponding with one of the parallel segments rendered on the page. \r\n\r\nDuring the navigation event, when we iterate over this data, we call `applyFlightData` with this data path & an empty cache node. `applyFlightData` checks to see if the flight data contains cache nodes (\"seed data\"). If it doesn't, then that means it has no work to do, and it bails out.  Pre-PPR and in the case of having a `loading.js` file, `walkTreeWithFlightRouterState` doesn't return any seed data, just router state. This means that `applyFlightData` will not have any work to do on the new cache node, and leaves it untouched. \r\n\r\nOnce `applyFlightData` is finished, but while still in the flight data path loop, we reassign `currentCache` to the empty cache object we created prior to `applyFlightData`. But since that cache node has remained empty, the next iteration of the loop is going to be inspecting a now empty cache, rather than the actual \"current\" cache. Now there's no existing cache to copy into the new cache. The app now doesn't know about any cache nodes.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nIt doesn't seem like we should be re-assigning `currentCache` to the new cache. In the context of a navigation, it seems more accurate to always assume `currentCache` is the cache _now_, since it won't actually be applied to the state until the action has finished (`mutable.cache` is currently taking care of this).\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2223\r\nFixes #61080\r\nFixes #60682\r\nFixes #56701",

This doesn't actually replace anything yet, however aim to establish our napi bindings package can be built against wasm32 target.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWe currently have two bindings package to generate native / wasm target support, one for napi and one other for wasm. Recently napi-rs started to support to generate bindings for the wasm directly - which means we can get rid of the wasm-pack based bindings code entirely and maintain a single bindings code only.\r\n\r\nThis'll makes our `next-swc` simpler as well, since the invocation to the bindings now becomes identical we don't have to additional wasm specific logics to invoke functions (i.e transform, transformsync..). Also napi generates wasi-supported wasm bindings, provides few more features to the current wasm bindings.\r\n\r\n#### Good\r\n- Async napi binding fn works transparently (`transform`, `minify`...)\r\n- (Experimental) thread supports depends on node.js runtime\r\n- Wasi support: i.e it can even read filesystem directly!\r\n\r\n#### Things to consider\r\n- node.js's wasi support is experimental yet\r\n- napi-rs's wasm support is in beta yet, specifically `packaging` generated wasm output.\r\n\r\nDue to `things to consider` reasons, this PR does not replace existing wasm target yet. We should be able to plan out things later.\r\n\r\n**What happens to the turbopack api in napi bindings?**\r\n\r\nSimply put, this **does not support turbopack in wasm**. Build works by disabling turbopack (more notably, underlying dependency doesn't support wasm) features. It is something to explore separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses PACK-2367\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a branch at https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61586 shows quick demo for importing, running sync / async / read external files.",

    "description": "### What\r\nWhen a prefetch cache entry becomes \"stale\", it'll remain stale until eventually it gets evicted. However during that stale window, the cache is never revalidated, and so instant navigations stop working and data is fetched from origin every navigation.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nThe `lastUsedTime` entry on the prefetch cache is currently only updated after the first read. Once it becomes stale, `applyFlightData`'s recursive functions will see that there is no longer a reusable prefetch cache entry, and will trigger a lazy fetch of the new data on every subsequent navigation. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis updates prefetch cache handling to always ensure we‚Äôre using a fresh or reusable prefetch cache entry. This means that stale prefetch entries will be refreshed on a navigation event. As a result of this, I‚Äôve had to disable one of our tests that relies on this stale cache behavior. It‚Äôs not ideal that we‚Äôre blocked on the loading boundary when fetching child segment data‚Äîideally we can refactor this to cache the loading component in the CacheNode and copy it over on navigations, similar to how ‚Äòhead‚Äô is handled. I‚Äôll work on this in a separate PR. \r\n\r\nNote: The new client cache test for this is disabled in PPR for the same reason as the other tests: auto prefetching with PPR navigations is currently loading fresh data rather than reusing the prefetch cache. \r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #58969\r\nFixes #58723\r\nCloses NEXT-1904\r\n",

    "description": "## What?\n\nFixes the `should update server components pages when env files is changed (edge)` tests. In order for changes to the environment to apply to edge-runtime routes we need to call `clearModuleContext`, currently that only supports a single path being provided, but in Turobpack the compilation is much more granular than webpack, in case of webpack we loop through all items coming out of the compilation and invalidate them regardless, which is not needed for Turbopack. Instead, when an entrypoint (route) is recompiled it'll automatically only invalidate that part. For `.env` changes that don't affect compilation, which is what the test checks, this wouldn't be sufficient as there is no compilation difference between changing those env vars. In the case that you change `.env` / tsconfig/jsconfig we have to clear all module contexts, which is what this PR implements.\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Feel free to leave suggestions if needed, this has always confused me a little bit.\r\n\r\n**Old Version**:\r\nFor example, if you have a Dynamic Route like `/dashboard/[user]` that you want to present differently via middleware, you would write: `<Link href={{ pathname: '/dashboard/authed/[user]', query: { user: username } }} as=\"/dashboard/[user]\">Profile</Link>`.\r\n\r\nThe `as` prop should be the URL we want to display while href/pathname is the actual path.

For `NEXT_PUBLIC_` changes normal Turbopack HMR will kick in already but this test was checking env vars that do not affect the compiled output, so Turbopack would not trigger a HMR as no inputs changed. Similarly webpack doesn't either and it implements this call in a similar way.\r\n\r\nFor edge runtime there's a different bug where changes are not propagated even when you refresh, so while this change does fix another bug for edge runtime it doesn't solve that underlying issue where the values don't update to begin with.

For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n'use server'\r\n\r\nexport async function foo () {}\r\nexport const bar = a_value_we_dont_know_yet ? foo : async () => {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the compiler will always wrap `createActionProxy` for every exported value and assume they're different Server Actions (hence different IDs). With this fix, if we find that it's already defined before, we just return the defined reference as they're strictly identical so the ID does't matter.\r\n\r\nCloses #54655, closes #61183.\n\nCloses NEXT-2264",

    "description": "### What\r\nPrefetches to pages within a shared layout would frequently cache miss despite having the data available. This causes the \"instant navigation\" behavior (with the 30s/5min TTL) to not be effective on these pages. \r\n\r\n### Why\r\nIn #59861, `nextUrl` was added as a prefetch cache key prefix to ensure multiple interception routes that correspond to the same URL wouldn't clash in the prefetch cache. However this causes a problem in the case where you're navigating between sub-pages. To illustrate the issue, consider the case where you load `/foo`. This will populate the prefetch cache with an entry of `{foo: <PrefetchCacheNode}`. Navigating to `/foo/bar`, with a link that prefetches back to `/foo`, will now result in a new cache node: `{foo: <PrefetchCacheNode>, /foo/bar%/foo: <PrefetchCacheNode>}` (where `Next-URL` is `/foo/bar`). Now we have a cache entry for the full data, as well as a cache entry for a partial prefetch up to the nearest loading boundary. Now when we navigate back to `/foo`, the router will see that it's missing data, and need to lazy-fetch the data triggering the loading boundary. \r\n\r\nThis was especially noticeable in the case where you have a route group with it's own loading.js file because it creates a level of hierarchy in the React tree, and suspending on the data fetch would result in the group's loading boundary to be triggered. In the non-route group scenario, there's still a bug here but it would stall on the data fetch rather than triggering a boundary. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nIn #61794 we conditionally send `Next-URL` as part of the `Vary` header if we detect it could be intercepted. We use this information when creating the prefetch entry to prefix it, in case it corresponds with an intercepted route. \r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2193\r\n",

For example, `@foo/[...catchAll]/page` as a parallel route on `/page.tsx` should not match on `/`, but it should match on `/foo`, `/bar`, ...etc\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nThe catch-all route normalization logic doesn't treat optional catch-all routes differently from catch-all routes. The assumption was if any catch-all route was found, that it should match the path that shared its prefix.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis updates the normalization logic to handle optional-catchall as it was in the original implementation. For regular catch-all, we ensure that the catch-all base path (for `/[...slug]` that'd be `/`) isn't identical to the path we'd match it to.\r\n\r\nFixes #60613\r\nCloses NEXT-2243\r\n",

    "description": "### What?\r\nInterception routes on dynamic paths don't currently work when PPR is turned on, and instead trigger an MPA navigation to the full route.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nRoute interception relies on the `Next-Flight-Router-State` header to extract the dynamic params necessary to convert something like `[locale]`, which would correspond with a URL of `/en`, to something like `[\"locale\", \"en\", \"d\"]`.  (See [this function](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/fbfd7b5f81397fc6500e3c3a25bfd6627e9abb8f/packages/next/src/server/app-render/app-render.tsx#L129-L137) for more info). When PPR is turned on, we currently ignore this request header and don't provide it to the functions that render the component tree. \r\n\r\nWithout the flight router state, this function bails out and instead will leave the segment key as `[locale]`. When the client router goes to diff the current tree on the client with the response from the server, it will detect a mismatch between the current segment and the incoming segment, and trigger an MPA navigation in [this block](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/fbfd7b5f81397fc6500e3c3a25bfd6627e9abb8f/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/reducers/navigate-reducer.ts#L414-L416).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis special-cases interception routes to not strip this header.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2215",

Specifically it needs to know about the `Next-Router-State-Tree` when generating the interception route RSC data, which isn't available at build time. This doesn't currently cause any usage issues, but it erroneously emits static files & RSC payloads that the client router won't be able to use and will instead fallback to a dynamic request. \r\n\r\nI removed some special case in an existing test since this fix also resolves a discrepancy in behavior when PPR is turned on\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis excludes interception routes from `appStaticPaths` at builds which currently determines which pages should be statically generated.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2190",

    "description": "This PR improves the Server Actions SWC transform to make it able to handle nested Action declarations (check `fixture/server-actions/server/28/input.js` for more details).\r\n\r\nIt is also a simplification of that transform's internal states and methods, with the removal of an extra AST pass (`stmts.visit_mut_with(&mut ClosureActionReplacer { replaced_action_proxies: &self.replaced_action_proxies, })`). The generated code is also smaller in some cases. So overall I'd expect the compilation and runtime performance to improve as well.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWith this change, we're now using `self.declared_idents` and `self.names` to track closure arguments. `declared_idents` keeps the identifiers **declared** in the current closure and above. `names` keeps identifiers **appeared** in the current closure and above. In an example of the following cursor:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet x\r\n\r\nasync function foo() {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  let y\r\n\r\n  async function bar() {\r\n    \"use server\"\r\n    let z\r\n    console.log(x, y, z)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // <- cursor\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`declared_idents` would be `y` (`x` isn't in a closure), and `names` would be `x, y, z`.

The reason for this was that we automatically detect the root of the project based on the closest lockfile (i.e. package-lock.json). In this particular test a new package-lock.json was added and since this suite is not yet isolated it cases problems.\n\nThis PR adds `outputFileTracingRoot` to explicitly provide the root of the project, which ensures the right files are resolved. \n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

    "title": "fix: status code for 404 props queries to avoid client side navigation with empty props",
    "description": "### What?\r\nCurrently, when a middleware is active and the path results in a 404, the server responds with a 200 status code to data requests. We propose a change to ensure that a 404 status code is returned in these situations, as expected, solving production issues for the navigation router.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nThe client data requests (identified with `_next/data` path & `x-nextjs-data` header) get answered the status code 200. The code below is executed when there is a version skew for the data requests (e.g prefetch in production).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/4125069840ca98981f0e7796f55265af04f3e903/packages/next/src/server/lib/router-server.ts#L217-L227\r\n\r\nThe version skew consists in the client side version identified with the buildId in `__NEXT_DATA__ ` tag to be obsolete compared to the server version (`BUILD_ID` file).\r\n\r\nIn the case of prefetching, this leads to the code above being executed, therefore the `prefetch-reducer.ts` handles the response as valid and sets it in its cache. Which ultimately triggers a navigation with empty prop, resulting in erroneous behaviours reported in issues and in our production websites:\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/4125069840ca98981f0e7796f55265af04f3e903/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/reducers/prefetch-reducer.ts#L54-L74\r\n\r\nBy switching the response to a 404, we trigger this code in the fetch (`fetchServerResponse`). This change prompts a hard navigation (mpaNavigation), effectively refreshing the client version and resynching it with the server version.\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/4125069840ca98981f0e7796f55265af04f3e903/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/fetch-server-response.ts#L125-L134\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nWe simply update the status code to 404 here:\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/4125069840ca98981f0e7796f55265af04f3e903/packages/next/src/server/lib/router-server.ts#L223\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/60785\r\nCloses: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/59295\r\nFixes: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/47516\r\n",

If you visit https://next-2173.vercel.app/, you get loginSegments: __DEFAULT__ (hard navigation) or children (soft navigation after returning from a visit to /login)\r\n2. If you soft nav to (/app/@auth/login and /app/@nav/login) https://next-2173.vercel.app/login, you get \r\n    1. loginSegment: `children` (expected value should be `login`)\r\n    2. navSegment: `children` (expected value should be `login`)\r\n3. If you soft nav to (/app/@auth/reset) https://next-2173.vercel.app/reset, you get\r\n    1. loginSegments: `children` (expected value should be `reset`)\r\n    2. navSegment: `children` (expected value should be `login`)\r\n4. If you soft nav to (/app/@auth/reset/withEmail) https://next-2173.vercel.app/reset/withEmail, you get\r\n    1. loginSegments: `children` (expected value should be `withEmail`)\r\n    2. navSegment: `children` (expected value should be `login`)\r\n5. ~If you hard nav to (/app/@auth/reset/withEmail) https://next-2173.vercel.app/reset/withEmail, you get an unexpected result due to possibly another bug:~\r\n    * ~navSegment is `null` on the deployed (Vercel) version, the navSlot is *not* loaded~\r\n    * ~navSegment is `__DEFAULT__` on local dev, the navSlot loads `/app/@nav/default.tsx`.~\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nIn `packages/next/src/client/components/navigation.ts`, `getSelectedLayoutSegmentPath` is called and returns the correct segmentPath for parallel routes (even though there is a TODO comment indicating this function needs to be updated to handle parallel routes) but `useSelectedLayoutSegment` failed to return the correct segment when a parallelRouteKey is provided.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n`useSelectedLayoutSegment` is updated to return selectedLayoutSegments[0] for non parallel routes (original logic), but it will return the last segments for parallel routes (or null if nothing is active).\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn parallelRouteKey === 'children'\r\n    ? selectedLayoutSegments[0]\r\n    : selectedLayoutSegments[selectedLayoutSegments.length-1] ?? null\r\n```",

    "title": "Support resuming a complete HTML prerender that has dynamic flight data",
    "description": "followup to: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/60645\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nWhen prerendering the determination of whether a prerender is fully static or partially static should not be directly related to whether there is a postponed state or not. When rendering RSC it is possible to postpone because a dynamic API was used but then on the client (SSR) the postpone is never encountered. This can happen when a server component is passed to a client component and the client component conditionally renders the server component.\r\n\r\nToday if this happens the entire output would be considered static when in fact the flight data encoded into the page and used for bootstrapping the client router contains dynamic holes. Today this is blocked by an error that incorrectly assumes that this case means the user caught the postpone in the client layer but as shown above this may not be the case.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nA more capable model is to think of the outcome of a prerender as having 3 possible states\r\n1. Dynamic HTML: The HTML produces by the prerender has dynamic holes. we save the static prelude but expect to resume the render later to complete the HTML. This means we will resume the RSC part of the render as well\r\n2. Dynamic Data: The HTML is completely static but the RSC data encoded into the page is dynamic. We don't want to resume the render but we do need to produce new inlined RSC data during a Request.\r\n3. Static: The HTML is completely static and so is the RSC data encoded into the page. We save the entire HTML output and there will be no dynamic continuation when this route is visited.\r\n\r\nReally 1 & 3 are the same as today (Partially static & Fully Static respectively) but case 2 which today errors in a confusing way is now supported.\r\n\r\nIn addition implementing the Dynamic Data case the old warning about catching postpones is removed. The reason we don't want this is that catching postpones is potentially a valid way to do optimistic UI. We probably want a first-party API for it at some point (and maybe we'll add the warning back in once we do) but imagine you do something dynamic like look up a user but during prerender you want to render as if the user is logged out. you could call `getUser()` in a try catch and render fallback UI if it throws. In this case we'd detect a dynamic API was used but we wouldn't have a corresponding postpone state which would put us in the Dynamic Data case (2).\r\n\r\nAnother item to note is that we can produce a fully static result even if there is a postponed state because users may call postpone themselves even if they are not calling dynamic APIs like headers or cookies. When this happens we don't want to statically capture a page with postponed boundaries in it. Instead we immediately resume the render and abort it with a postponed abort signal. This will cause the boundaries to immediately enter client render mode which should speed up recovery on the client.\r\n\r\n#### Technical Note\r\n\r\nAnother note about the implementation is that you'll see that regardless of which case we are in, if there is a postponed state but we consider the page to be Dynamic Data meaning we want to serialize all the HTML and NOT do a resume in the dynamic continuation then we immediately resume the render with and already aborted AbortSignal. The purpose here is to mark any boundaries which have dynamic holes as being client-rendered.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule if the render produces a postponed state we must do one of the following\r\n1. save the postponed state and ensure there is a dynamic continuation that calls resume\r\n2. immediately resume the render and save the concatenated output and ensure the dynamic continuation does NOT call resume.\r\n\r\nor said another way, every postponed state must be resumed (even if it didn't come from Next's dynamic APIs)\r\n\r\n#### Perf considerations\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies a few key areas to improve perf.\r\n\r\nReduces quantity of *Stream instances where possible as these add significant overhead\r\nReduces extra closures to lower allocations and keep functions in monomorphic form where possible\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2164",

So we check if they change before applying hot updates, and then use it later with `isUpdateAvailable()` to determine if necessary to process a new hot update\r\n\r\nThere's a early return in the warnings condition which lead to confusing can be optimized, we removed it and dropped the incorrect condition at the end where we apply the hot updates.

    "description": "formalizes the concept of dynamic APIs inside Next to allow for varying semantics beyond just staticGenerationBailout.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic APIs\r\n\r\n#### `markCurrentScopeAsDynamic`\r\nuseful to bail out of default caching semantics but does not imply a Request specific data source was read. critically, this semantic is ignored if you are inside a cache scope\r\n\r\n#### `trackDynamicDataAccessed`\r\nMust be called before reading any data source that is derived from Request specific data. Currently this is `cookies()`, `headers()`, and `searchParams`. This kind of data access inside a cache scope is forbidden (it always should have been, but now it will error).\r\n\r\n#### `trackDynamicFetch`\r\nThis one is unideal but the complexity of patch-fetch's current implementation necessitates it for now. Essentially it will postpone if we are prerendering. Long term this should be eliminated with a refactor of patch fetch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Improvements\r\nAlso removes the `staticGenerationBailout` implementation as it has been replaced with more specific logic in the places it was previously being used.\r\n\r\nOne area that has also been enhanced is the proxy for app-route modules. Previously we proxied the Request every time however when we are doing non-static generation executions we generally don't want the overhead of wrapping the request. In the refactor here I also improved the runtime performance by using static proxy handlers and I believe I also fixed a few bugs related to `clone` and `url`\r\n\r\nIn general there has been a bit of refactoring to clarify how we should handle various render/execution states and a reduction in implicit side effects for proper execution.\r\n\r\nAnother callout to notice is that app-route modules do not attempt a static generation if they are force-dynamic regardless of the PPR setting. Previously the PPR setting would opt them into this code path which is not necessary because PPR itself does not work for routes, only pages.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2099",

We should render the full, cached dynamic data immediately.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, on a popstate navigation, we update the cache to drop the prefetch data for any segment whose dynamic data was already received. We clone the entire cache node tree and set the `prefetchRsc` field to `null` to prevent it from being rendered. (We can't mutate the node in place because Cache Node is a concurrent data structure.)\r\n\r\nTechnically, what we're actually checking is whether the dynamic network response was received. But since it's a streaming response, this does not mean that all the dynamic data has fully streamed in. It just means that _some_ of the dynamic data was received. But as a heuristic, we assume that the rest dynamic data will stream in quickly, so it's still better to skip the prefetch state.\n\nCloses NEXT-2084",

    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen using catch-all routes in conjunction with parallel routes, and when importing a client component (`\"use client\"`), the build would fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n> Could not find the module \"PathToClientComponent\" in the React Client Manifest. This is probably a bug in the React Server Components bundler.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n`flight-manifest-plugin` generates manifests for each page entry. The `clientModules` portion of this manifest is used by React to load the appropriate client module. When React attempts to render a component tree and detects a module that it cannot find, it will throw this error. To illustrate why it isn't in the tree, consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp\r\n  page.tsx\r\n  layout.tsx\r\n  @slot\r\n    [...catchAll]\r\n      page.tsx\r\n```\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n// app/layout.tsx\r\nexport default function Layout({children, slot}) {\r\n  return <>{children} {slot}</>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```tsx\r\n// app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx\r\nimport Link from 'next/link'\r\nexport default function Page() {\r\n  return <Link href=\"/\">Test</Link>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen visiting `/`, we'd expect both the catch-all `@slot` and the root page to render. At build time, we'll generate a client reference manifest for `/` and `/[...catchAll]` since both are page components. However, the `@slot` imports a client component. When we attempt to load the client reference manifest for `/`, it will ignore the catch-all slot's manifest, resulting in the error.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThe `entryNameToGroupName` function seems to already exist to handle this scenario for other cases. For example, `app/(group)/@named/foo/page` needs to know about any manifests associated with `app/foo`. This updates the code to apply similar handling to catchAll segments. When applying this change to the example mentioned earlier, it will properly merge the manifests for both `app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` because both will be part of the `/` group. \r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1908\r\nFixes #59747\r\nFixes #59510\r\n",

In the case where the navigation error does not beat out the error emitted by dynamic API's will still trigger the detection warning that's present to warn you about situations where you may have accidentally caught the error.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n\r\nThis resolves this issue by explicitly checking for navigation signals (errors) thrown during the render, and not displaying the \"caught dynamic API\" error and console warning.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2037",

    "description": "The original motivation of this PR is to get `unstable_cache` into a state where I can more easily change the implementation of postpone to be more akin to \"dynamic rendering APIs\". the existing approach made typing the staticGenerationStore in a way I wanted to for the planned changes would have been hard to implement with the current approach. At the same time this was an opportunity to make the implementation more efficient and easier to reason about.\r\n\r\nreorganizes unstable_cache to improve performance and potentially fix latent bugs related to nest cache calls\r\n\r\nIn the original implementation there are repeated defined checks for the store and relatively complex logic around gathering the cache entry. In my refactor I fork the implementation based on whether we have a store or not. Loosely this translates to whether the cache call is for App Router vs Pages Router however due to a quirk in how we scope inner cache calls there is an existing and unchanged case where a Pages Router cached callback runs with a \"fake\" store that is used to scope some cache values to prevent inner caching when one cached function calls another. It should be noted that this fake store technique means that inner cache calls inside Pages Router will hit the App Router pathway in unstable cache. This is not great but it is the current behavior and while I have made some changes that might fix some bugs changing this felt like a much bigger lift to do in a primarily refactor PR.\r\n\r\nThis \"fake\" store can be replaced by a different async store for Pages Router which we can use to scope the inner environment to not be cached eventually though it may make more sense to just generalize the staticGenerationStore into a kind of RenderStore and have it run for Pages Router too.\r\n\r\nI moved as much computation that can be done in the closure around the cached function out of the cached function and I narrowed the scope of the run call to make it clear that we really only need to scope the callback.\r\n\r\nI removed function allocations per invocation\r\n\r\nI probably fixed a bug in how the revalidate property was refined on the static generation store. Previously it would be possible to go from number to false and back again but this doesn't make sense as false is more like INFINITY in terms of refining to shorter values.

The problem is not new - dynamic imports consider an absolute path in Windows as a protocol:\r\n\r\n`ERR!

    "description": "### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I have no idea how I managed to delete this, as I just copied the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had to figure out why the tests passed. When I test the running application locally, it works as expected.\r\n\r\nSo, when a route is first used in a running production application in a test, `ctx.fetchCache` is `undefined`. Therefore, the error rule does not trigger on the first request, and the cache is successfully written. This may result in artifacts in FetchCache in Vercel and possibly in other parts of the code.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (\r\n  ctx.fetchCache && // <- Undefined on first request\r\n  // we don't show this error/warning when a custom cache handler is being used\r\n  // as it might not have this limit\r\n  !this.hasCustomCacheHandler &&\r\n  JSON.stringify(data).length > 2 * 1024 * 1024\r\n) {\r\n  if (this.dev) {\r\n    throw new Error(`fetch for over 2MB of data can not be cached`)\r\n  }\r\n  return\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm 95% sure that this is a bug and it shouldn't work like this. I'll look into this later and if there is an error, I'll put it into a task and try to figure it out later.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the [test](https://github.com/vordgi/next.js/blob/7e028fb6d8598cfcca8de514e4608374f931c973/test/e2e/app-dir/app-static/app-static.test.ts#L3080) from [previous PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/59976) is not working yet, although it is correct from my point of view.

If the segment keys of two layouts are the same, they are reused.\r\n\r\nHowever, the server doesn't bother to assign segment keys to the leaf segments (which we refer to as \"page\" segments) because they are never part of a shared layout. It assigns all of them a special constant (`__PAGE__`).\r\n\r\nIn the PPR implementation, I overlooked this and compared the segment keys of all segments, including pages, not just shared layouts. So if the only thing that changed during a navigation was the page data, and not any parent layout, the client would fail to apply the navigation.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add a special case for page segments before comparing nested layouts. I also moved an existing special case for default pages, since those are also leaf segments and are conceptually similar.",

    "title": "fix catch-all route normalization for default parallel routes",
    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen relying on a `default` route as a fallback, greedier catch-all segments in the application hierarchy would take precedence, causing unexpected errors/matching behavior. \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhen performing parallel route catch-all normalization, we push potential catch-all matches to paths without considering that a path might instead be matched by a `default` page. Because of this, the catch-all take precedence and the app will not try and load the default.\r\n\r\nFor example, given this structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"/\": [\"/page\"],\r\n  \"/[[...catchAll]]\": [\"/[[...catchAll]]/page\"],\r\n  \"/nested/[foo]/[bar]\": [\"/nested/[foo]/[bar]/@slot/page\"],\r\n  \"/nested/[foo]/[bar]/[baz]\": [\"/nested/[foo]/[bar]/@slot/[baz]/page\"],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Where there's a `/nested/[foo]/[bar]/default.tsx`)\r\n\r\nThe route normalization logic would produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"/\": [\"/page\"],\r\n  \"/[[...catchAll]]\": [\"/[[...catchAll]]/page\"],\r\n  \"/nested/[foo]/[bar]\": [\r\n    \"/nested/[foo]/[bar]/@slot/page\",\r\n    \"/[[...catchAll]]/page\",\r\n  ],\r\n  \"/nested/[foo]/[bar]/[baz]\": [\r\n    \"/nested/[foo]/[bar]/@slot/[baz]/page\",\r\n    \"/[[...catchAll]]/page\",\r\n  ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis means that when building the `LoaderTree`, it won't ever try to find the default for that segment. **This solution operates under the assumption that if you defined a `default` at a particular layout segment, you intend for that to render in place of a greedier catch-all.** (Let me know if this is an incorrect assumption)\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nWe can't safely normalize catch-all parallel routes without having context about where the `default` segments are, so this updates `appPaths` to be inclusive of default segments and then filters them when doing anything relating to build/export to maintain existing behavior. We use this information to check if an existing default exists at the same segment level that we'd push the catch-all to. If one exists, we don't push the catch-all. Otherwise we proceed as normal.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1987\r\n",

These options may improve the performance of builds at the cost of more memory.\r\n\r\n`parallelServerAndEdgeCompiles`: This option kicks off the builds for both `server` and `edge-server` at the same time instead of waiting for each to complete before the next one. In applications that have many server and edge functions, this can increase performance by doing that work in parallel. This can be used with `next build` or `next experimental-compile`.\r\n\r\n`parallelServerBuildTraces`: This option starts the server build traces as soon as the server compile completes and runs it in the background while the other compilations are happening. With this option enabled, some unnecessary work may be done since ordinarily the client compilation provides information that can reduce the amount of tracing necessary. However, since it is in parallel with the other work, it may still result in a faster build in total at the cost of more memory. This option is already the default when using `next experimental-compile` but can now be used when `next build` is used also.",

    "description": "Previously in #58967 we set all the module type as `'es6'` to let swc parse app router code as ESM and output as ESM due to the incorrect detection of CJS module by auto-cjs plugin, but this is not accurate when the external library bundle is CJS. The problem is when swc compiling modern syntax for example private properties in CJS bundle but emitted the swc helpers with ESM imports.\r\n\r\nWe had a auto-cjs swc plugin to determine if the file is using CJS or not, @kdy1 fixed the bug of it so now we can use the default module type, and let the plugin to determine its module type, to make sure we're emitting the right helpers.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1942\r\nBased on #60118 ",

This lets it wait for any in-flight requests to finish processing before exiting the process\r\n- Sends `SIGKILL` to the child process in `next dev`, which should have the same effect of immediately shutting down the server on `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`\r\n\r\nfixes: #53661\r\nrefs: #59551\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nPreviously #59551 attempted to fix #53661, but had broken some tests in the process.

    "description": "### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nDisable 2MB limit for custom incrementalCacheHandler\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe limit is necessary because `FetchCache` has a 2MB limit, but it seems there was a miscommunication regarding the key coincidence, where `fetchCache` is a flag indicating that the method is called from fetch, rather than indicating that the `FetchCache` Provider is currently being used.\r\n\r\nWe do not use Vercel, and as I understand it, we do not have the opportunity to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is more important for us to increase the limits, and in some cases, using a file storage is even preferable.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI have created a flag that determines whether the use of `FetchCache` is possible at least in theory - if no custom provider is passed, and additionally configured it so that it is not an implementation of `FetchCache` as a protection against special individuals (*like me :)*).\r\n\r\nIf everything is fine, I will write proper tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to recommend making `FileSystemCache` public (_i.e. support it as public functionality_) so that it can be imported and extended or simply used to fix only it.\r\n\r\nFixes #48324 (partially)",

    "description": "## What\r\n\r\nWhen users specify `\"type\": \"module\"` in Next.js app, especially with `create-next-app`, `Image` component is not working. An error `Unsupported Server Component type: {...}` is thrown.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\n`next/image` API is mixing with a client component as default export and a named export as server component. But the entry file of the API is still CJS file, which will import the module as the object. So you'll get `{ default, unstable_getImageProps }` when you do `import Image from 'next/image'` instead of `Image` component itself, where the CJS module load all the exports as an object. This is expected behavior for ESM but breaks the usage.\r\n\r\nIt only errors when you're using js extensions, if you're using typescript, it still works. If you're using turbopack, it works in dev mode.\r\n\r\nThis is also because webpack can't analyze the exports from CJS module of that `next/image` entry file. Usually we can assign the default export to the module itself, then attach other named exports onto it, so the default export equals the `module.exports` itself. But for `next/image` since the default export is an client component, doing that will error with React as you cannot modify the react client reference.\r\nTurbopack doesn't use the same way to analyze the default export, so it doesn't have this problem.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\nWe create few ESM version of entry files of nextjs APIs, then pick up them to let app router for bundling, instead of using the `next/<api name>.js` CJS files. Those ESM entries still point to the `next/dist/..` CJS files. In this way webpack and directly gets the exports from the `next/dist/...` files and be aware of the module exports. No more CJS module wrapping the ESM module, the default and named exports can preserve correctly.\r\n\r\nFixes #54777\r\nCloses NEXT-1774\r\nCloses NEXT-1879\r\nCloses NEXT-1923",

It was too narrow, causing prefetched segments that contained dynamic holes to sometimes be treated as if they were complete. The net effect was that the dynamic data would never stream in, and the page would get stuck in a fallback state until the stale prefetch was eventually purged from the cache, or the user refreshed the page.\r\n\r\nThe reason the mistake happened was, as an incremental step, I decided to fallback to the non-PPR implementation for any case where I hadn't yet implemented the equivalent functionality. I think still think this is a good strategy, despite the mistake, but I'm eager to get everything migrated to the new model as soon as possible.\r\n\n\nCloses NEXT-1920",

    "description": "### What?\r\nCatch-all routes are being matched to parallel routes which causes issues like an interception route being handled by the wrong page component, or a page component being associated with multiple pages resulting in a \"You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path\" build error.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n#58215 fixed a bug that caused catchall paths to not properly match when used with parallel routes. In other words, a catchall slot wouldn't render on a page that could match that catch all. Or a catchall page wouldn't match a slot. At build time, a normalization step was introduced to take application paths and attempt to perform this matching behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever in it's current form, this causes the errors mentioned above to manifest. To better illustrate the problem, here are a few examples:\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  '/': [ '/page' ],\r\n  '/[...slug]': [ '/[...slug]/page' ],\r\n  '/items/[...ids]': [ '/items/[...ids]/page' ],\r\n  '/(.)items/[...ids]': [ '/@modal/(.)items/[...ids]/page' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe normalization logic would produce:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  '/': [ '/page' ],\r\n  '/[...slug]': [ '/[...slug]/page' ],\r\n  '/items/[...ids]': [ '/items/[...ids]/page' ],\r\n  '/(.)items/[...ids]': [ '/@modal/(.)items/[...ids]/page', '/[...slug]/page' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe interception route will now be improperly handled by `[...slug]/page` rather than the interception handler.\r\n\r\nAnother example, which rather than incorrectly handling a match, will produce a build error:\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  '/': [ '/(group-b)/page' ],\r\n  '/[...catcher]': [ '/(group-a)/@parallel/[...catcher]/page' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe normalization logic would produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  '/': [ '/(group-b)/page', '/(group-a)/@parallel/[...catcher]/page' ],\r\n  '/[...catcher]': [ '/(group-a)/@parallel/[...catcher]/page' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe parallel catch-all slot is now part of `/`. This means when building the loader tree, two `children` parallel segments (aka page components) will be found when hitting `/`, which is an error. \r\n\r\nThe error that was added here was originally intended to help catch scenarios like:\r\n`/app/(group-a)/page` and `/app/(group-b)/page`. However it also throws for parallel slots, which isn't necessarily an error (especially since the normalization logic will push potential matches). \r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThere are two small fixes in this PR, the rest are an abundance of e2e tests to help prevent regressions. \r\n\r\n- When normalizing catch-all routes, we will not attempt to push any page entrypoints for interception routes. These should already have all the information they need in `appPaths`.\r\n- Before throwing the error about duplicate page segments in `next-app-loader`, we check to see if it's because we already matched a page component but we also detected a parallel slot that would have matched the page slot. In this case, we don't error, since the app can recover from this. \r\n- Loading a client reference manifest shouldn't throw a cryptic require error. `loadClientReferenceManifest` is already potentially returning undefined, so this case should already be handled gracefully\r\n\r\nSeparately, we'll need to follow-up on the Turbopack side to:\r\n- Make sure the duplicate matching matches the Webpack implementation (I believe Webpack is sorting, but Turbopack isn't)\r\n- Implement #58215 in Turbopack. Once this is done, we should expect the tests added in this PR to start failing.\r\n\r\nFixes #58272\r\nFixes #58660\r\nFixes #58312\r\nFixes #59782\r\nFixes #59784\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1809\r\n",

    "description": "### What?\r\nNavigating to a layout that is part of a route group that uses route interception currently will trigger a 404 error if the route group doesn't define a `default` segment.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhen `next-app-loader` injects fallback defaults into the loader tree, it does so by first seeing if a default already exists. However it does this without ignoring route groups, meaning if you have a `/app/default.tsx` and your interception route is at `/app/(level1)/(level2)`, it will look for the default at `/app/(level1)/(level2)/default.tsx`. \r\n\r\nWhen a `default` isn't found, the fallback behavior is to trigger a `notFound()` error. This means navigating to the intercepting route that has no `default` for the `children` segment will 404.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis adjusts the fallback behavior by attempting to find the `default` by normalizing the segment path, which will ignore route groups. That way `/app/(level1)/(level2)/default` will first check `/app/default.tsx` before falling back to `notFound` behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #59279\r\nCloses NEXT-1813\r\n",

    "description": "For a more detailed explanation of the algorithm, refer to the comments in ppr-navigations.ts. Below is a high-level overview.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Render the prefetched data immediately\r\n\r\nImmediately upon navigation, we construct a new Cache Node tree (i.e. copy-on-write) that represents the optimistic result of a navigation, using both the current Cache Node tree and data that was prefetched prior to navigation.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we haven't yet received the navigation response from the server. It could send back something completely different from the tree that was prefetched ‚Äî due to rewrites, default routes, parallel routes, etc.\r\n\r\nBut in most cases, it will return the same tree that we prefetched, just with the dynamic holes filled in. So we optimistically assume this will happen, and accept that the real result could be arbitrarily different.\r\n\r\nWe'll reuse anything that was already in the previous tree, since that's what the server does.\r\n\r\nNew segments (ones that don't appear in the old tree) are assigned an unresolved promise. The data for these promises will be fulfilled later, when the navigation response is received.\r\n\r\nThe tree can be rendered immediately after it is created. Any new trees that do not have prefetch data will suspend during rendering, until the dynamic data streams in.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Fill in the dynamic data as it streams in\r\n\r\nWhen the dynamic data is received from the server, we can start filling in the unresolved promises in the tree. All the pending promises that were spawned by the navigation will be resolved, either with dynamic data from the server, or `null` to indicate that the data is missing.\r\n\r\nA `null` value will trigger a lazy fetch during render, which will then patch up the tree using the same mechanism as the non-PPR implementation (serverPatchReducer).\r\n\r\nUsually, the server will respond with exactly the subset of data that we're waiting for ‚Äî everything below the nearest shared layout. But technically, the server can return anything it wants.\r\n\r\nThis does _not_ create a new tree; it modifies the existing one in place. Which means it must follow the Suspense rules of cache safety.\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n\r\nNot all necessarily PR-blocking, since the status quo is that navigations don't work at all when PPR is enabled\r\n\r\n- [x] Figure out how to handle dynamic metadata. Need to switch from prefetched metadata to final.\r\n- [x] Some mistake related to parallel routes, need to look into failing tests\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1894",

    "title": "Fix parallel routes with server actions / revalidating router cache",
    "description": "### What?\r\nThere are a bunch of different bugs caused by the same underlying issue, but the common thread is that performing any sort of router cache update (either through `router.refresh()`, `revalidatePath()`, or `redirect()`) inside of a parallel route would break the router preventing subsequent actions, and not resolve any pending state such as from `useFormState`. \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n`applyPatch` is responsible for taking an update response from the server and merging it into the client router cache. However, there's specific bailout logic to skip over applying the patch to a `__DEFAULT__` segment (which corresponds with a `default.tsx` page). When the router detects a cache node that is expected to be rendered on the page but contains no data, the router will trigger a lazy fetch to retrieve the data that's expected to be there ([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/5adacb69126e0fd7dff7ebd45278c0dfd42f6116/packages/next/src/client/components/layout-router.tsx#L359-L370)) and then update the router cache once the data resolves ([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/5adacb69126e0fd7dff7ebd45278c0dfd42f6116/packages/next/src/client/components/layout-router.tsx#L399-L404)).\r\n\r\nThis is causing the router to get stuck in a loop: it'll fetch the data for the cache node, send the data to the router reducer to merge it into the existing cache nodes, skip merging that data in for `__DEFAULT__` segments, and repeat.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nWe currently assign `__DEFAULT__` to have `notFound()` behavior when there isn't a `default.tsx` component for a particular segment. This makes it so that when loading a page that renders a slot without slot content / a `default`, it 404s. But when performing a client-side navigation, the intended behavior is different: we keep whatever was in the `default` slots place, until the user refreshes the page, which would then 404. \r\n\r\nHowever, this logic is incorrect when triggering any of the above mentioned cache node revalidation strategies: if we always skip applying to the `__DEFAULT__` segment, slots will never properly handle reducer actions that rely on making changes to their cache nodes. \r\n\r\nThis splits these different `applyPatch` functions: one that will apply to the full tree, and another that'll apply to everything except the default segments with the existing bailout condition. \r\n\r\nFixes #54173\r\nFixes #58772\r\nFixes #54723\r\nFixes #57665\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1706\r\nCloses NEXT-1815\r\nCloses NEXT-1812",

    "description": "Implementation of feature request opened here - https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/59427\r\n\r\nApproach:\r\n\r\n~~We are using micromatch in the csrf protection step of actionHandler to allow for wildcard domains passed in allowedDomains. This is the same library used for matching domains for remote images.~~\r\n\r\nIf any of the allowed domains match the origin of the request, we skip the downstream error thrown for csrf protection.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nMicromatch is not available in this context as it is only compatible with Node. This codepath can be run from the edge, so we need to rely on vanilla js compatible code only. \r\n\r\nInstead of falling back to allowing the user to pass in a regex, which can be somewhat insecure, we opt into continuing to use a wildcard pattern from a configuration standpoint and instead use a simple function that matches on wildcards using string comparison and iteration.\r\n\r\nIdeally, Micromatch can be retrofitted to work in non-Node settings and this piece of code can be replaced in the future, without deprecating or changing the next.config interface.",

There're cases that packages can't be bundled that we're providing a `serverComponentsExternalPackages` experimental flag which is widly used for packages that can't be bundled, they're remained as external.\r\n\r\nIn webpack it will output the module based on if they're cjs or esm external, where cjs external pkg output will be `require('external-pkg')` and esm one will be `import('external-pkg')`.

For most actions this is fine, as most are currently async. However, `ACTION_RESTORE` (triggered when the `popstate` event occurs) isn't async, and introducing a small amount of delay in the handling of this action can cause the browser to not properly restore the scroll position\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis special-cases `ACTION_RESTORE` to synchronously process the action and call `setState` when it's received, rather than creating a promise. To consistently reproduce this behavior, I added an option to our browser interface that'll allow us to programmatically trigger a CPU slowdown. \r\n\r\nh/t to @alvarlagerlof for isolating the offending commit and sharing a minimal reproduction.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1819\r\nLikely addresses #58899 but the reproduction was too complex to verify.",

And the fix here is to ignore all layer info and React specific transforms here, as barrel optimization isn't related to all these framework features at all. To keep all directives unchanged, the SWC transform needs to parse and pass that info to the Webpack loader.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test to ensure that `@mui/material` is working as expected (less than 1500 modules compiled). Without this feature it'll be ~2400 modules.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1793, closes NEXT-1762.",

    "title": "loading.tsx should have no effect on partial rendering when PPR is enabled",
    "description": "Before PPR, the way instant navigations work in Next.js is we prefetch everything up to the first route segment that defines a loading.js boundary. The rest of the tree is defered until the actual navigation. It does not take into account whether the data is dynamic ‚Äî even if the tree is completely static, it will still defer everything inside the loading boundary.\r\n\r\nThe approach with PPR is different ‚Äî we prefetch as deeply as possible, and only defer when dynamic data is accessed. If so, we only defer the nearest parent Suspense boundary of the dynamic data access, regardless of whether the boundary is defined by loading.js or a normal <Suspense> component in userspace.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the partial behavior of loading.js when the PPR flag is enabled. In effect, loading.js now acts like a regular Suspense boundary with no additional special behavior.\r\n\r\nNote that in practice this usually means we'll end up prefetching more than we were before PPR, which may or may not be considered a performance regression by some apps. The plan is to address this before General Availability of PPR by introducing granular per-segment fetching, so we can reuse as much of the tree as possible during both prefetches and dynamic navigations. But during the beta period, we should be clear about this trade off in our communications.\r\n\r\n## Testing strategy\r\n\r\nWhile I was writing a test, I noticed that it's currently pretty difficult to test all the scenarios that PPR is designed to handle, so I gave special attention to setting up a testing strategy that I hope will make this easier going forward. The overall pattern is based on how we've been testing concurrent rendering features in the React repo for many years:\r\n\r\n- In the e2e test, spin up an HTTP server for responding to requests sent by the test app. This simulates the data service that would be used in a real Next.js application, whether it's direct db access, an ORM, or a higher-level data access layer. The e2e test can observe when individual requests are received, and control the timing of when the data is fulfilled, without needing to mock any lower level I/O. (We're already using a similar pattern to [test fetch deduping](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/a3616d33edc40e7717b258f2636f280e30a3bccb/test/e2e/app-dir/app-fetch-deduping/app-fetch-deduping.test.ts#L8-L29).)\r\n- Each time a request is received, write to an event log. Then assert on the result of the log at different points throughout the test. This helps catch subtle mistakes where the order of events is not expected, or the same event happens more than it should.\r\n\r\n(I wrote some test helpers, but to avoid early abstraction, I've intentionally not moved them into a separate module.)\n\nCloses NEXT-1779",

    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen using a server action on an intercepted route, when submitting that action, you'd expect it to correspond with the page you're currently on. However if you have route interception set up, and you load the page rather than the intercepted page, submitting the action would `POST` to the intercepted page. This would result in a 404 error because the action ID you're attempting to submit wouldn't be found on the requested page.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nInterception routes rely on the `Next-Url` request header to determine if an interception should occur via a rewrite. However, server actions are submitted with this header as well, so the rewrite will be applied to the `POST` request corresponding with a non-existent action, or an action on the intercepted page.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nWhen loading a page that has an intercepted route, `nextUrl` should be consistent with URL derived from the flight router state tree. But when an interception occurs via navigation, `nextUrl` will now deviate. I'm using this to determine whether or not `Next-Url` should be forwarded along in the `POST` request. \r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1436\r\nFixes #52591\r\nFixes #49934\r\nFixes #58049\r\n",

    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen the router action queue receives a bunch of async actions in quick succession, some of those requests are dropped, and as a result, anything observing pending transitions will be stuck in a pending state.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhen adding items to the action queue, the intended behavior is for new actions to be added to the end of the action queue, to be picked up by `runRemainingActions` once the in-flight action is processed. However, new actions are erroneously overwriting pending actions in the queue rather than appending them, as `actionQueue.last` might have a pending action attached to it. \r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis moves the assignment of `actionQueue.last` to always be in `dispatchAction`, rather than the function that processes the action, so that we always have a single spot where `last` is assigned and to prevent it from erroneously omitted/overwritten. \r\n\r\nFixes #59011\r\n",

    "description": "## What?\r\n\r\nWas investigating an issue with Turbopack and MDX, in the process found a few bugs:\r\n\r\n- When you have a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` the `baseUrl: '.'` is used by default which causes the top-level directories to be available as e.g. `design-system` (without a prefix).\r\n\t-  This is not how TypeScript's default setting for `baseUrl` works. While it should resolve `paths` relative to `.` when none is specified it does not do additional resolving for the top level directories/files.\r\n\t- When `\"baseUrl\": \".\"` is added to `tsconfig.js` explicitly it handles the top level directories.\r\n- `modularizeImports` and other SWC transforms weren't applied to `.mdx` files when `experimental.mdxRs` is enabled, which caused compilation to fail.\r\n- `modularIzeImports` and other SWC transforms are not applied to `.mdx` files when using Turbopack.\r\n\t- @kwonoj is investigating this, will be handled in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\n- Added a test suite for `modularizeImports` with MDX tests\r\n- Removed the condition that disables swcLoader in webpack when using mdxRs\r\n- Changed the check for `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` baseUrl to include if it was implicitly or explicitly set, disabled the module resolving when it is implicitly set\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

    "description": "After we landed #57784 we started to prefer ESM assets of 3rd party packages in app router bundles including both server (RSC, SSR layers) and client. But some of the packages are not 100% correct format for ES Module.\r\n\r\nThe packages triggered the bundling errors:\r\n\r\ne.g. `@pathfinder-ide/react` includes the below code\r\n```\r\nif (typeof module < \"u\")\r\n  try {\r\n    module.exports = Fd, Object.defineProperty(Fd, \"__esModule\", { value: !0 }), Fd.default = Fd, Fd.outdent = Fd;\r\n  } catch {\r\n ```\r\n\r\nwhich makes next-swc compiler think it's a CJS module since we didn't specify the output module type. Then you saw sometimes import a module will result into failed module exports resolving.\r\n\r\nIn #57962 it's the same case that when you import the mixed type of code into page, it might be compiled to CJS so you lost the ESM exports.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nTo align the preferred module type and compiled result, we explicitly specify the output module type to \"esm\", then it will still bundle as ESM.

This would result in stale data being displayed even after manually triggering a revalidation. \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nRevalidation calls are pushed onto a `pendingRevalidates` array and, in the case of a route handler, are awaited [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/8b11264ea95c9ed2f7dfd1e8d66a36b57ebc0da1/packages/next/src/server/send-response.ts#L53-L55).  \r\n\r\nPreviously this took place as part of the former `pipeReadable` implementation ([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/57bb52d37dd43fd669c5c07296daba19b6a12917/packages/next/src/server/send-response.ts#L49)) which awaited the promise before calling res.end ([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/57bb52d37dd43fd669c5c07296daba19b6a12917/packages/next/src/server/pipe-readable.ts#L99-L105)). There was a subtle change in behavior here in a recent refactor that seems to cause a race between awaiting the promise and ending the response, which results in this unpredictable behavior.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis applies similar logic that used to be in the `pipeReadable` function to the new `pipeToNodeResponse` function. Namely, we plumb `waitUntil` into the writeable stream close handler and await it before calling `res.end()`.\r\n\r\nThis is a very difficult edge case to test, and as such resorted to rigorous manual testing when deployed to an environment that uses the data cache. \r\n\r\nFixes #52962\r\nFixes #57632 ",

    "description": "## What?\n\nChanges the default resolve extensions to be consistent between server/client compilation.\n\nCurrently browser prefers `.mjs` then `.js` and the server compiler prefers `.js` then `.mjs`.\n\nI added that behavior back in 2018 before mjs/cjs extensions were fully baked and many npm libraries had incorrect usage of it (PR: #5898).\n\nIn the new setup with ESM resolving in Node.js writing out the full extension is required for `.mjs` files, meaning this \"magic resolving\" of a file to `.mjs` is no longer correct. In the future we'll likely want to remove `.mjs` from the default list of resolve extensions to align with the Node.js ESM resolver a bit more.\n\nFor now we have to keep it in order to not break existing applications that rely on that behavior, an example of that seems to be contentlayer.\n\n## How?\n\nRemoved the condition and aligned it on a single list instead of separate lists.\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

    "title": "disable static prefetching behavior for dynamic segments",
    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen a layout segment forces dynamic rendering (such as with `force-dynamic` or `revalidate: 0`), navigating to sub-pages of that layout will attempt to re-render the layout, also resulting in side effects re-running. This means if your layout relies on a data fetch and you render the result of that data in the layout, it will unexpectedly change when navigating between sub-paths, as described in #57326. \r\n\r\nAs a separate issue (but caused by the same underlying mechanism), when using `searchParams` on a dynamic page, changes to those search params will be erroneously ignored when navigating, as described in #57075\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nAs a performance optimization we generate static prefetch files for dynamic segments ([original PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/54403)). This makes it so that when prefetching is turned on, the prefetch can be served quickly from the edge without needing to invoke unnecessarily. We're able to eagerly serve things that can be safely prefetched. This is nice for cases where a path has a `loading.js` that we can eagerly render while waiting for the dynamic data to be loaded. \r\n\r\nThis causes a problem with layouts that opt into dynamic rendering: when the page loads and a prefetch is kicked off for the sub-page, it'll load the static prefetch, which won't be generated with the same router state as the dynamically rendered page. This causes a mismatch between the two trees, and when navigating within the same segment, a refetch will be added to the router because it thinks that it's navigating to a new layout.\r\n\r\nThis also causes issues for dynamic pages that use `searchParams`. The static prefetch will be generated without any knowledge of search params, and when the prefetch occurs, we still match to the prefetch generated without search params. This will make the router think that no change occurs, and the UI will not update to reflect the change.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThere's ongoing work by @acdlite to refactor the client router. Hopefully it will be easier to re-land this once that work is finished. For now, I've reverted the behavior as it doesn't seem to be worth the bugs it currently causes. I've also added tests so that when we do re-land this behavior, we can catch these subtleties. \r\n\r\nFixes #57326\r\nFixes #57075\r\n",

    "title": "Add cacheNodeSeedData to RSC payload",
    "description": "This adds an additional item to the FlightData type. The type of the field is currently `null`, but eventually this slot will represent a tree of data that is used to seed the cache nodes.\r\n\r\nThis is a fragile change because the FlightData type is not covered by TypeScript. This was an intentional decision to optimize the size of the Flight payload. It's made more tricky because there are many places in the codebase that access the fields of FlightData using direct indexing, e.g. `flightData[0]`.\r\n\r\nTo minimze the number of places I needed to update, I added the new field to the end of the array. However, many places access the fields using negative indexing (via the `slice` method), so I needed to update all of those. I also had to change any place that checked the length of the array.\r\n\r\nIn the future, when we introduce clever types like this that are intentionally unsound, we should contain the unsoundness to a single module by only accessing the type with getter functions. Something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst treePath = getTreePatch(flightData);\r\nconst seedData = getCacheNodeSeedData(flightData);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThat way when we add a new field like this, we don't have to carefully update every single place that accesses the type. (TypeScript lacks the ability to mark a type as opaque, unfortunately, but I believe you can simulate it in other ways. This is one feature I miss from Flow.)\r\n\r\nI considered adding these getter methods as part of this PR, but since we're in the middle of a larger refactor of the Flight response type, I'd prefer to change as little as possible for now until we can land an MVP of PPR for client navigations. (That being said, if we struggle to land this, I'll reconsider.)\r\n\r\nMy strategy for finding the places that needed to update was to change the type of FlightDataPath to a nonsense type (e.g. number) and track down all the TypeScript errors. I also searched for all references to variables named `flightDataPath` or similar. I also referred to a prior PR, #42791, which added the `head` field to the FlightDataPath type.\r\n\r\nBecause of the nature of the change, there's a moderately elevated risk that this will break something. However, if something does slip through the cracks, it's likely to fail fast, given how common most of these paths are; I expect any egregious oversights would be caught by our e2e test suite.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

The reason was that both `write` and `close` from a write stream are async operations and it's best to wait for them to complete, otherwise the promise returned from `body.pipeTo` could resolve before all data has been written and the stream was closed. Right after that it calls `rename` and it could happen that, at that point, `tempFile` doesn't contain all the data yet which means an empty file may be renamed into another file ending up with `path.join(cacheDirectory, tarFileName)` being empty as well.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to wait for both `write` and `close` to be completed which eliminates the potential race condition between the fetch and the rename.",

    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen `FetchCache` is used, cache gets were incorrectly bailing. This would result in unexpected behavior, like continuously revalidating a cache key, as described in #57978.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n#57902 introduced a refactor to the `FileSystemCache` and changed the interface of `get`, but this change was not propagated to `FetchCache`. Specifically, `fetchCache` was removed in favor of a new type `kindHint`. As a result, cache reads would always short circuit because `fetchCache` would never be defined.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThis updates the interface on `FetchCache` to match what is defined on the base `CacheHandler`. I've also updated the args to both `get` and `set` to be derived from `CacheHandler` so we don't have any type inconsistencies in the future.\r\n\r\nI will be following up with a test in the CLI repo to test against a deployed app (since minimalMode cannot be easily mocked in our test suite).

    "description": "### What?\r\nWhen navigating between pages (via `prefetch: false`) within a dynamic segment, the shared layout is re-rendered. This can cause unexpected behavior like layout data changing when navigating between child segments.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhen prefetch is false, we're currently opting into an \"optimistic navigation\" codepath, which will optimistically render layout-routers up to the point where data is missing, while kicking off data fetches. It attempts to determine where refetching needs to happen by traversing the router cache nodes and checking where data is missing. However, it locates these cache nodes by using \"segments\" obtained by [deconstructing the URL](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/fix/optimistic-bailout/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/reducers/navigate-reducer.ts#L142), which won't accurately contain dynamic segment data. For ex, `/en` which corresponds with `/app/[lang]/page.tsx` will have a cache node key of `lang|en|d`, not `en`. Similarly, the optimistic tree that gets constructed will also be incorrect, since it uses the URL segment.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nMy initial fix was to match the dynamic segment against the segment constructed by the URL. But after discussion with @sebmarkbage and the team, it seems more correct to remove the optimistic case all together as there's no guarantee that the url will actually match to that segment.\r\n\r\nFixes #50670 \r\n\r\n\r\n",

During static generation, we should not write to the response directly as the revalidation for static responses is performed out of band from the actual request/response as a stale version can be served early. This is partially addressed by modifying the `onHeaders` to only write when there it is not during static generation, but long term I'd hope to see that we can instead pass a immutable request and `null` for the response to help indicate to the render pipeline that it should instead persist the data into the `RenderResult` objects. Alternatively, the response could use a mocked version that would then supersede the `RenderResult` and be used instead.\r\n\r\n2. The types for rendering App Pages were merged incorrectly, so this additionally restructures the way that we initialize those renderers such that only the options that are applicable to each renderer is passed down.",

PR updates logic to parse config in the module to allow single segment export as well.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't allow _both_, if config object is exported it'll short-curcuit to read values as config object should able to specify runtime without separate runtime segment.\n\nCloses PACK-1961",

    "title": "Improve Server Actions compiler",
    "description": "Currently to make inline-defined Server Actions work, the compiler hoists the actual `\"use server\"` function to the module level and convert the inlined function to a parentheses expression that creates a noop wrapper function and wraps it with the proxy. This works fine however expressions are still different from declarations (#57392). So there're some details that can't be aligned well.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we're going to make the compilation for the two types of inline-defined Server Actions more robust and more lightweight:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Expressions\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst action = async () => { \"use server\" ... }\r\nconst action = async function () { \"use server\" ... }\r\nconst action = async function named () { \"use server\" ... }\r\nfoo={async function () { \"use server\" ... }}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese expressions can directly be replaced with a new expression `createActionProxy(\"id\", hoisted_action)`. A `.bind(...)` member call can be followed if it needs to bind any variables from the closure level.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Declarations\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function named () { \"use server\" ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we replace all the same `named` idents to be the expression `createActionProxy(\"id\", hoisted_action)`, and removed that function declaration.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, these will be fewer structural changes to the AST and the code is more performant.\r\n\r\nThe PR also changes it to use React's `registerServerReference` method directly instead of our in-house implementation inside `createActionProxy`.\r\n\r\nAnother small change is to stabilize the comment header to use `BTreeMap` inside the SWC transform. Otherwise the test snapshots will randomly mismatch.\r\n\r\nCloses #57392.",

    "description": "Next.js's implementation includes a custom Thenable type based on a similar one used in React's codebase. It was used to implement a userspace equivalent of the React.use API before that API became stable, by throwing a promise-like object and tracking the status on an expando field. However, it didn't cover all the same cases and behaviors that React.use does, which led to some subtle bugs like the one fixed by @ztanner in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/55690.\n\nNow that React.use is stable, and we use that for suspending instead of throwing a promise, we no longer need our custom Thenable type. I've removed the type and associated functions, and updated our types to use Promise instead.\n\nEven in cases where a function does return a thenable-object rather than a native promise, like React Flight's createFromFetch, we should use TypeScript's built-in PromiseLike utility. Currently, though, we always await these objects anyway (in fetch-server-response.ts), which turns them into promises. So Promise is almost always sufficient.",

    "description": "## What?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for manually calling `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`.\r\n\r\nIt's currently under an experimental flag:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\r\n */\r\nconst nextConfig = {\r\n  experimental: {\r\n    windowHistorySupport: true,\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nGoing forward I'll refer to `history.pushState` as `replaceState` is interchangable.\r\n \r\nWhen the flag is enabled you're able to call the web platform `history.pushState` in the usual way:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst data = {\r\n\tfoo: 'bar'\r\n}\r\nconst url = '/my-new-url?search=tim'\r\nwindow.history.pushState(data, '', url)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's start by explaining what would happen without the flag:\r\n\r\nWhen a new history entry is pushed outside of the Next.js router any back navigation to that history entry will cause a browser reload as it can no longer be used by Next.js as the required metadata for the router is missing. In practice this makes it so that pushState/replaceState is not feasible to be used. Any pathname / searchParams added can't be observed by `usePathname` / `useSearchParams` either.\r\n\r\nWith the flag enabled the pushState/replaceState calls are instrumented and is synced into the Next.js router. This way the Next.js router's internal metadata is preserved, making back navigations apply still, and pathname / searchParams is synced as well, making sure that you can observe it using `usePathname` and `useSearchParams`.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\n- Added a new experimental flag `windowHistorySupport`\r\n- Instruments `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`\r\n\t- Triggers the same action as popstate (ACTION_RESTORE) to sync the provided url (if provided) into the Next.js router\r\n\t- Copies the Next.js values kept in history.state so that they are not lost\r\n\t- Calls the original pushState/replaceState\r\n\r\n~~Something to figure out is how we handle additional pushes/replaces in Next.js as that should override the history state that was previously set.~~\r\nWent with this after discussing with @sebmarkbage:\r\n- When you open a page it preserves the custom history state\r\n\t- This is to solve this case: when you manually `window.history.pushState` / `window.history.replaceState` and then do an mpa navigation (i.e. `<a>` or `window.location.href`) and the navigate backwards the custom history state is preserved\r\n- When you navigate back and forward (popstate) it preserves the custom history state\r\n- When you navigate client-side (i.e. `router.push()` / `<Link>`) the custom history state is not preserved",

    "description": "## Description\r\n\r\nBetween 14.0.2-canary.6 and 14.0.2-canary.7, a change was introduced in vercel/next.js#56497 that turned the Redux store state into a Promise, rather than a synchronous state update.\r\n\r\nThis caused the `sync` function -- used to send state updates to the Redux Devtools -- to be recreated on every dispatch, which in turn, by referential instability, caused the `HistoryUpdater` component to re-render and trigger a `history.replaceState` with no particular change, but with the internal `canonicalUrl`.\r\n\r\nWhen an app does a soft/shallow navigation by calling history methods directly (currently the only way to do shallow search params updates in the app router), these changes would have been overwritten by any prefetch (eg: hovering or mounting a Link), which is usually a no-op for the navigation state.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `sync` function to take the state as an argument rather than as a closure. The whole app router state is also unwrapped only once, and fed to the HistoryUpdater. Changes to its contents made by reducers will cause the HistoryUpdater effect to re-run, triggering history updates and a call to the sync function.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nI maintain [`next-usequerystate`](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate), which is used in the Vercel dashboard, and which is impacted by this change (see \r\n[#388](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate/issues/388)).\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\n@timneutkens introduced the `sync` function and the whole Redux devtools reducer in vercel/next.js#39866, with the note:\r\n\r\n> a new hook useReducerWithReduxDevtools has been added, we'll probably want to put this behind a compile-time flag when the new router is marked stable but until then it's useful to have it enabled by default (only \r\nwhen you have Redux Devtools installed ofcourse). \r\n\r\nIf a different direction is needed to keep sending `RENDER_SYNC` actions to Redux devtools, I'll be happy to rework this PR to move the `sync` function into the action queue.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Added e2e test. Requires a `start` mode as prefetch links are disabled in development. Test was verified to fail from next@>=12.0.2-canary.7 without the fix.\r\n",

    "description": "This PR fixes a bug where parallel routes would not apply appropriately on navigation when used within slots.\r\n\r\nThe following scenarios:\r\n```\r\n/foo\r\n   /bar\r\n   /@slot\r\n     /[...catchAll]\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\n/foo\r\n  /[...catchAll]\r\n  /@slot\r\n     /bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill now function correctly when accessing /foo/bar, and Next.js will render both /bar and the catchall slots.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that the tree constructed by `next-app-loader` for a given path, /foo/bar in the example, would not include the paths for the catch-all files at build time. The routing was done 1-1 when compiling files, where a path would only match one file, with parallel routes, a path could hit a defined path but also a catch all route at the same time in a different slot.\r\n\r\nThe fix consists of adding another normalisation layer that will look for all catch-all in `appPaths` and iterate over the other paths and add the relevant information when needed.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part was making sure that we only included the relevant paths to the loader: we don't want to overwrite a slot with a catch all if there's already a more specific subpath in that slot, i.e. if there's /foo/@slot/bar/page.js, no need to inject /foo/@slot/bar/[...catchAll]. \r\n\r\nOne thing that is not supported right now is optional catch all routes, will add later.\r\n\r\nfixes #48719\r\nfixes #49662\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

This works by listening to the `onHeaders` event.\r\n\r\nIn particular it's interesting for PPR because if you have something dynamic outside a Suspense boundary it generates an empty payload without any preloads in it. That's because when we do render the real shell we don't know what the document will look like. However, we can emit the `Link` header for CSS, images and font preloads that we've already discovered. In effect, even a dynamic page gets PPR benefits by early fetching resources.\r\n\r\nCustom headers is supported for static a ROUTE but not a PAGE. So I had to add similar wiring to forward headers when it's a page being rendered.\r\n\r\nIt's important that this works every where, including dynamic routes, because otherwise we might miss out on preloads that we previously would've had.",
