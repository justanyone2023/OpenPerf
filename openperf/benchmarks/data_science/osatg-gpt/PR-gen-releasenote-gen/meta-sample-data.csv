"microsoft/terminal_3391","key bindings now support arguments ; check the default settings for some examples of how this works","add support for arbitrary args in keybindings [sep] enables the user to provide arbitrary argument values to shortcut actions through a new args member of keybindings . for some keybindings , like newtabwithprofile < n > , we previously needed 0 different shortcutactions , one for each value of index . if a user wanted to have a newtabwithprofile11 keybinding , that was simply impossible . now that the args are in their own separate json object , each binding can accept any number of arbitrary argument values . so instead of : . { `` command '' : `` newtab '' , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+t '' ] } , . { `` command '' : `` newtabprofile0 '' , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+1 '' ] } , . { `` command '' : `` newtabprofile1 '' , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+2 '' ] } , . { `` command '' : `` newtabprofile2 '' , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+3 '' ] } , . { `` command '' : `` newtabprofile3 '' , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+4 '' ] } , . we can now use : . { `` command '' : `` newtab '' , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+t '' ] } , . { `` command '' : { `` action '' : `` newtab '' , `` index '' : 0 } , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+1 '' ] } , . { `` command '' : { `` action '' : `` newtab '' , `` index '' : 0 } , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+2 '' ] } , . { `` command '' : { `` action '' : `` newtab '' , `` index '' : 0 } , `` keys '' : [ `` ctrl+shift+3 '' ] } , . initially , this does seem more verbose . however , for cases where there are multiple args , or there 's a large range of values for the args , this will quickly become a more powerful system of expressing keybindings . the `` legacy '' keybindings are left in in this pr . they have helper methods to generate appropriate iactionargs values . prior to releasing 1.0 , i think we should remove them , if only to remove some code bloat . see the spec for more details . i work here . ran tests . removed the legacy keybindings from the defaults.json , everything still works . tried leaving the legacy keybingings in my profiles.json , everything still works . [sep] this is a start , but there 's a weird linker bug if i take the setkeybinding ( shortcutaction , keychord ) implementation out , which i do n't totally understand.a good old-fashioned clean will fix that right up.all these things work.hey this actually _functionally_ works.mostly cleanup and completion of implementation.hey i bet we could just make newtab the handler for newtabwithprofile.start writing tests for keybinding args.add tests.revert a bad sln change , and clean out dead code.merge branch 'master ' into dev/migrie/f/1142-arbitrary-args.area-settings.product-terminal ."

"microsoft/terminal_5319","the box cursors should now more accurately represent double-width glyphs","show a double width cursor for double width characters [sep] this pr will allow the cursor to be double width when on top of a double width character . this required changing iscursordoublewidth to check whether the glyph the cursor 's on top of is double width . the ones that seemed to be relevant/repro-able , i attempt to address in this pr . the iscursordoublewidth check would fail during the textbuffer : :reflow call inside of terminal : :userresize occasionally , particularly when newcursor.enddeferdrawing ( ) is called . this is because when we tell the newcursor to enddefer , the renderer will attempt to redraw the cursor . as part of this redraw , it 'll ask if iscursordoublewidth , and if the renderer managed to ask this before userresize swapped out the old buffer with the new one from reflow , the renderer will be asking the old buffer if its out-of-bounds cursor is double width . this was pretty easily repro 'd using cmatrix -u0 and resizing the window like a madman . as a solution , i 've moved the start/end deferdrawing calls out of reflow and into userresize . this way , i can `` clamp '' the portion of the code where the newbuffer is getting created and reflowed and swapped into the terminal buffer , and only allow the renderer to draw once the swap is done . this also means that conhost 's resizewithreflow needed to change slightly . in addition , i 've added a writelock to setcursoron . cla signed . manual validation that the cursor is indeed chonky , added a test case to check that we are correctly saying that the cursor is double width ( not too sure if i put it in the right place ) . also open to other test case ideas and thoughts on what else i should be careful for since i am quite nervous about what other crashes might occur . [sep] first lets add back the code that crashes.adding a test that may or may not work.test case.i just add debug for now.merge branch 'master ' into dev/lelian/bigcursor.maybe.ridding myself of comments.y fail if it would n't matter hmm.why do n't we just take these calls and place them over here.merge branch 'master ' into dev/lelian/bigcursor.area-terminalcontrol.automerge.product-terminal ."

'getter ' = > function ( person $ person , forminterface $ form ) : string { . return $ person- > firstname ( ) . ' '. $ person- > lastname ( ) ; . } , . 'setter ' = > function ( person & $ person , ? string $ name , forminterface $ form ) : void { . $ person- > rename ( $ name ) ; . } , . ] ) ; . this would give us the same possibilities as data mappers , but within the form field scope , where : . $ person is the view data , basically the underlying data to the form . $ form is the current child form that is being mapped . $ name is the submitted data that belongs to that field . these two callbacks will be executed following the same rules as for property paths before read and write any value ( e.i . early return if empty data , skip mapping if the form field is not mapped or it 's disabled , etc ) . what this also proposes . i based the implementation on solving this problem first : . [ ... ] the property_path option defines the rules on how it 's accessed . from there , the actual way it is accessed ( direct property access , accessors , reflection , whatever ) are hidden from view . all that matters is the property path ( which is deduced from the name if not explicitly set ) . [ ... ] . so splitting the default data mapper propertypathmapper into two artifacts : `` datamapper '' and `` dataaccessor '' would allow us adding multiple data accessors along the way ( the code that varies in this case ) without having to reinvent the wheel over and over again ( the data mapper code ) . you can also think about a new reflectionaccessor for instance ? or use this callbackaccessor to map your form partially from an external api ? yes , you could do it : ) . here is a view of the proposed changes : . where `` datamapper '' will take care of common checks , iterates the given child forms , manages the form data and all what is needed for mapping a standard form , whereas `` dataaccessor '' will take care of how to read and write values to/from the underlying object or array . bc . the propertypathmapper is being deprecated in favor of datamapper class , which uses the propertypathaccessor by default . although datamapper is now the default for each compound form , the behavior must remains the same ( tests prove it ) . so that if getter or setter option is null ( they 're by default ) the callbackaccessor will falls back to propertypathaccessor either for reading or writing values . sorry for the long description , but i think that sometimes it is necessary for too complex issues and big changes . besides , now you know a little more about what these changes is about . wdyt ?

"tailwindlabs/tailwindcss_2651","support ` extend ` in ` variants ` configuration","support ` extend ` in ` variants ` config [sep] this pr makes it possible to extend your variants configuration to avoid having to write out the entire default variant list whenever you want to enable an extra variant . for example , this is what it looks like to add focus-within to the backgroundcolor plugin traditionally : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'responsive ' , 'focus-within ' , 'hover ' , 'focus ' ] . } . } . this is what it would look like after this pr is merged : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . extend : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'focus-within ' ] . } . } . } . this is a non-breaking change and does n't break or remove any existing functionality . motivation . trying to extend variants has been the source of a lot of issues , discord questions , forum posts , etc . over the years , as it 's very common for people to do something like this and then be surprised that all of the default variants stopped working : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'focus-within ' ] . } . } . it 's challenging to solve this problem though because the order of your variants matters , because it affects the order your css is generated in and css source order affects specificity . for example , take a look at this html : . < button class= '' bg-blue 0 hover : bg-pink 0 focus : bg-green-500 '' > . < ! -- ... -- > . < /button > . given this configuration : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'hover ' , 'focus ' ] . } . } . ... when the button is both hovered and focused , the background is green , because the focus styles are defined after the hover styles . with this configuration : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'focus ' , 'hover ' ] . } . } . ... when the button is both hovered and focused , the background is pink , because now the hover styles are taking precedence over the focus styles . for this reason we punted on trying to solve this problem for a long time , because when someone needed to add a new variant , they also needed some way to say where in the list that variant should be added . eventually , i added this function-driven api that let you specify the position of a variant using helpers like before and after like so : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : ( { before } ) = > before ( [ 'focus-within ' ] , 'hover ' ) . } . } . this would add the focus-within variant before the hover variant in the existing list . this totally works and is a very flexible api , but it is fairly cryptic looking , especially to people who are n't expert javascript programmers . it gets especially cryptic when you start trying to compose before and after together like this : . module.exports = { . variants : { . // defaults are [ 'responsive ' , 'hover ' , 'focus ' ] . backgroundcolor : ( { before , after , without } ) = > without ( . [ 'focus ' ] , . before ( [ 'active ' ] , 'hover ' , after ( [ 'focus-within ' ] , 'responsive ' ) ) . ) , . // output : [ responsive ' , 'focus-within ' , 'active ' , 'hover ' ] . } , . } . yeah it works but man that is some insane looking shit . we need a better way ! i regret adding this api and will likely stop documenting it after this pr is merged . detailed design . this pr uses a new approach based on the existing extend behavior people are used to from the theme section . you simply add the variants you want to enable under the extend section , and they are merged with any other configured variants for that plugin . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . extend : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'focus-within ' ] . } . } . } . handling sort order . to handle the sort order , we maintain a `` recommended sort order '' list in tailwind that is stored in the default config under variantorder : . module.exports = { . // ... variantorder : [ . 'first ' , . 'last ' , . 'odd ' , . 'even ' , . 'visited ' , . 'checked ' , . 'group-hover ' , . 'group-focus ' , . 'focus-within ' , . 'hover ' , . 'focus ' , . 'focus-visible ' , . 'active ' , . 'disabled ' , . ] , . // ... } . when you use extend , we merge your extended variants with any other configured variants , then sort them using this list as a reference . overriding sort order . if you want to change the sort order , you can override the variantorder key in your own config : . module.exports = { . // ... variantorder : [ . 'focus ' , . 'last ' , . 'odd ' , . 'group-hover ' , . 'visited ' , . 'checked ' , . 'group-focus ' , . 'hover ' , . 'disabled ' , . 'even ' , . 'focus-within ' , . 'focus-visible ' , . 'active ' , . 'first ' , . ] , . // ... } . tailwind will use this as the new reference list when sorting things . overriding sort order per plugin . tailwind will only sort your variants if you are actually using the extend feature for that plugin . if you 'd like to have total control over the sort order per plugin , just set up your variant list the same way you alread do now : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'responsive ' , 'focus ' , 'hover ' , 'focus-within ' ] . } . } . since in this example we are n't using the extend feature for the backgroundcolor plugin , tailwind will not attempt to sort it , and instead trust that you have put the variants in the order that you want them in . working with third-party variant plugins . if you are using any plugins that add variants to tailwind , those variants will always be added at the beginning of the variant list by default when using extend and triggering sorting : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . extend : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'focus-within ' , 'custom-variant ' ] . // = > 'responsive ' , 'custom-variant ' , 'focus-within ' , 'hover ' , 'focus ' . } . } . } . you can put the variant in a specific place by simply not using extend and providing the whole list yourself : . module.exports = { . // ... variants : { . backgroundcolor : [ 'responsive ' , 'focus-within ' , 'hover ' , 'custom-variant ' , 'focus ' ] . // = > . } . } . ... or by adding the custom variant to your variantorder configuration : . module.exports = { . // ... variantorder : [ . 'first ' , . 'last ' , . 'odd ' , . 'even ' , . 'visited ' , . 'checked ' , . 'group-hover ' , . 'group-focus ' , . 'focus-within ' , . 'custom-variant ' , . 'hover ' , . 'focus ' , . 'focus-visible ' , . 'active ' , . 'disabled ' , . ] , . // ... } . we recommend just copying the default sort order from the default config and using it as a starting point when you need to do this , effectively just taking ownership of the list and managing it yourself . future improvements . we may eventually consider supporting a function syntax for variantorder so you can more easily insert custom variants in specific positions in the list , but that is not included at the time of this pr .

"ruby-grape/grape_1194","redirect as plain text with message","redirect as plain text with message . [sep] summary . this change forces redirect to use a content type of text/plain to both bypass any serialization attempts by the formatters and more closely meet the spec defined for redirection . backstory . the original issue here was concerned with the xml formatter attempting to serialize an empty body when an redirect was invoked . the situation can happen when an api is limited to xml only , or when xml is supported and requested . the spec . the http spec for redirection states : . unless the request method was head , the entity of the response should contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new uri ( s ) . i interpret this as indicating that a message body is preferred when responding with a redirect for statuses 301 , 302 , 303. proposal . set the body of a redirect to an object that supports all default serializations - to_json , to_xml , to_s - and allow the client to negotiate the content type . default redirect to use text/plain and allow the user to override when invoked . as i though about it over the weekend a third option seemed to make sense - really a derivation of the second above - where we just simple force the content type to text/plain and add a nicely formed message that fulfills the theme of the spec . this is relatively safe in that it does n't limit the framework from supporting optional extensions for redirects in the future . the biggest gain i think is that it removes complication for 99 % of the users out there as it will 'just work ' as i believe they 'll expect it to even if they choose to limit or customize content types . hopefully this will work or at least spark a solution . please let me know if you all have better ideas .

"microsoft/LightGBM_3883","[ dask ] remove 'client ' kwarg from fit and predict","[ dask ] remove 'client ' kwarg from fit and predict ( fixes ) [sep] this pr proposes a different pattern for how users can provide a dask client to model objects in the dask module . it removes the keyword argument client from fit ( ) and predict ( ) . as of this pr , users can optionally pass a client into the model 's constructor . if they do that , it is saved on the model object and used by fit ( ) and predict ( ) . otherwise , distributed.default_client ( ) is used at runtime . given that you 've set up a cluster and client ... import lightgbm as lgb . from distributed import localcluster , client . cluster = localcluster ( ) . client = client ( cluster ) . ... any of the following would work as of this pr . keyword arg in constructor . clf = lgb.dasklgbmclassifier ( client=client ) . clf.fit ( x , y ) . updating after construction with ` .set_params ( client=client ) ` . clf = lgb.dasklgbmclassifier ( ) . clf.set_params ( client = client ) . clf.fit ( x , y ) . never telling lightgbm to use a specific client . clf = lgb.dasklgbmclassifier ( ) . clf.fit ( x , y ) . why prefer this pattern ? i think the dasky-est approach would be to ... assume that they have initiated a client already . i do think that allowing an optional argument to the model constructor is a reasonable and useful addition ; you might just want to have separate things fitting on different clusters simultaneously . this pattern of an optional keyword-only argument in the constructor makes the signatures of .predict ( ) and .fit ( ) identical to those in the scikit-learn model objects . i was also about to work around not being able to pickle a model object that had a dask client as an attribute , which was my main concern with that approach . changes in this pr . adds optional keyword-only argument client to constructor for dask model objects . adds option for users to set a model object 's dask client by using .client after construction . removes keyword argument client from .fit ( ) and .predict ( ) for dask model objects . adds a __getstate__ ( ) method on lightgbm.sklearn.lgbmmodel , to handle removing a stored dask client from a model before serializing it . ( see the pickle docs for information on how this works ) . adds unit tests that dask model objects can be successfully serialized and read back in with pickle , joblib , and cloudpickle . copies the constructor from lightgbm.sklearn equivalents into the dask module , so that customizing documentation works correctly ( see comment on the relevant part of the diff ) . adds a unit test that the signatures for dask model objects and their sklearn equivalent are identical . notes for reviewers . using the docs/jlamb branch so we can see readthedocs builds . i chose not to label this breaking because there has never been a lightgbm release with the dask module . this change does make lightgbm 's api different from the one in dask-lightgbm , but that should n't be considered a breaking change from lightgbm 's perspective . this pr makes that explicit with tests . i know this is a small pr but with a lot of explanation and considerations . thank you for your time and energy reviewing it !

'' are optional , while the other ones are mandatory service dependencies . the injected service locators should not allow access to any other services not specified by the method . it is expected that servicesubscriber instances consume psr-11-based service locators internally . this interface does not dictate any injection method for these service locators , although constructor . injection is recommended . / . interface servicesubscriberinterface . { . / . returns an array of service types required by such instances , optionally keyed by the service names used internally . for mandatory dependencies : . array ( 'logger ' = > 'psr\log\loggerinterface ' ) means the objects use the `` logger '' name . internally to fetch a service which must implement psr\log\loggerinterface . array ( 'psr\log\loggerinterface ' ) is a shortcut for . array ( 'psr\log\loggerinterface ' = > 'psr\log\loggerinterface ' ) . otherwise : . array ( 'logger ' = > ' ? psr\log\loggerinterface ' ) denotes an optional dependency . array ( ' ? psr\log\loggerinterface ' ) is a shortcut for . array ( 'psr\log\loggerinterface ' = > ' ? psr\log\loggerinterface ' ) . / . public static function getsubscribedservices ( ) ; . } . we could then have eg a controller-as-a-service implement this interface , and be auto or manually wired according to the return value of this method - using the `` kernel.service_subscriber '' tag to do so . eg : . services : . app\controller\foocontroller : . tags : . - name : kernel.service_subscriber . key : logger . service : monolog.logger.foo_channel . the benefits are : . it keeps the lazy-behavior gained by service locators / container injection . it allows the referenced services to be made private from the pov of the main symfony dic - thus enables some compiler optimizations . it makes dependencies autowirable ( while keeping manual wiring possible ) . it does not add any strong coupling at the architecture level . and most importantly and contrary to regular container injection , it makes dependencies explicit - each classes declaring which services it consumes . some might argue that : . it requires to be explicit - thus more verbose . yet many others think it 's a good thing - ie it 's worth it . some coupling happens at the dependency level , since you need to get the di component to get the interface definition . this is something that the php-fig could address at some point .

"influxdata/influxdb_18040","allow for min or max y-axis visualization settings rather than min and max","feat ( y_axis_domain ) : updated y-axis domain settings to allow min or max values to be set . [sep] purpose . the purpose of this pr is to allow users to set a y-domain min/max value without requiring users to set both . in other words , a user should be able to set the y-domain with either a min or a max , and should not be required to set both . considerations . this feature required a removal of current restrictions on setting domain values , such as : . no empty values . min < = max . the ramifications of these changes were addressed by dynamically setting empty values based on the data range that is returned . if a user set their minimum value to 0 , and left the maximum value blank , the upper bounds of their range would be set dynamically based on the data range . similarly , if a user set their maximum value to 0 and left he minimum value blank , the lower bounds of their range would be set dynamically based on the data range . in effect , this treats the non-blank input values as the source of truth for data range visualization . therefore , if a user sets the minimum y value to be greater than the upper bounds of the data range values , and leaves the maximum value blank , then no data will show up ( since it is beyond the range ) . similarly , if a user sets the maximum y value to be less than the lower bounds of the data range values and leaves the minimum value blank , then no data will show up ( for the same reason as before ) . the images below list off the different use cases : . auto set : . set minimum blank : . set fields blank : . set the min greater than the max data range : . set the min > max : . set the min , does n't set the max : . set max less than the min data range : . set both : . changelog.md updated with a link to the pr ( not the issue ) . [sep] feat ( y_axis_domain ) : updated y-axis domain settings to allow min or max values to be set .. feat ( explorer.test ) : added a small cypress test to ensure feature visualization stability . also updated the changelog.chore ( changelog ) : updated changelog.feat ( vis ) : added tests to test new functionality.fix ( usevisdomainsettings ) : removed test that was accidentally added.fix ( function_changes ) : made suggested pr changes to function placement , testids , and safe-guarding types.fix ( parsebounds-usevisdomainsettings ) : updated usevisdomainsettings & parsebounds to usevisxdomainsettings & parsexbounds for greater specificity.merge branch 'master ' into feat/min-or-max-y-axis.feat ( getremainingrange ) : updated the way we were defaulting extent.fix ( extent_defaulting ) : updated the way extent defaults were so that it 's only happening once ."

"ray-project/ray_14012","dashboard now supports being served behind a reverse proxy .","make requests sent by the dashboard reverse proxy compatible [sep] this pr needs manual testing and tests in general . ? many users serve the ray dashboard behind a reverse proxy . at the moment , not all of the requests sent by the ray dashboard are formatted such that they will find the ray dashboard server when it is served behind a reverse proxy . the kinds of users that want to do this are those that want to integrate ray into a larger web application . large web applications often have complex architectures , lots of routes of their own , and reverse proxying in order to send requests to the right place . this change is key to enabling these types of web applications to integrate with ray . key changes . requesthandlers.ts . this file formats urls such that they are `` reverse proxy compatible '' . these changes should `` just work '' . i chose to create an http request helper file because this will help safeguard future developers from accidentally writing requests that do n't work behind a reverse proxy . this file should be treated as the canonical way to send http requests in the dashboard . working with api.ts . in order to not disrupt the entire dashboard app too much , i opted to not replace the usage of fetch in this file and instead export a url formatting function from the requesthandlers.ts file . the dashboard to use the centralized handlers only in the future . i had to remove the use of url , because url relies on the use of an absolute base url in order to instantiate the url object . this prs changes are directly in conflict with how the url object is instantiated . i manually verified this in chrome . my changes to this file will need testing and extra attention . how the dashboard is build . from now on , the dashboard will be built like public_url= '' .

"redis/redis_8133","fix the selection of a random element from large hash tables","fix random element selection for large hash tables . [sep] when a database on a 0 bit build grows past 2^31 keys , the underlying hash table expands to 2^32 buckets . after this point , the algorithms for selecting random elements only return elements from half of the available buckets because they use random ( ) which has a range of 0 to 2^31 - 1. this causes problems for eviction policies which use dictgetsomekeys or dictgetrandomkey . over time they cause the hash table to become unbalanced because , while new keys are spread out evenly across all buckets , evictions come from only half of the available buckets . eventually this half of the table starts to run out of keys and it takes longer and longer to find candidates for eviction . this continues until no more evictions can happen . this solution addresses this by using a 0 bit prng when needed . performance . to test the performance impact of this change , we used a lua script to rapidly insert keys into databases at max memory using the affected eviction policies and compared results with and without this change . there were no meaningful differences with all databases achieving around 100k evictions per second . test coverage . while the basic eviction functionality is covered by existing tests , there is n't one that covers what happens after 2^31 keys . because of the time and memory required to run a test like this i did not add one .

"hashicorp/vagrant_8558","core : add support for preferred providers","rfc : vagrant_preferred_providers [sep] fedora distributes and supports the libvirt and docker providers , and does not distribute or support virtualbox . this implies a different set of priorities from those in upstream vagrant , meaning the priorities called out by the individual provider plugins . with the existing code in vagrant , the only way for fedora to express system-level provider priorities is to set vagrant_default_provider , but that has the undesired effect of short-circuiting the rest of vagrant 's nuanced algorithm for choosing a provider : . the -- provider flag on a vagrant up is chosen above all else , if it . is present . if the vagrant_default_provider environmental variable is set , it . takes next priority and will be the provider chosen . vagrant will go through all of the config.vm.provider calls in the . vagrantfile and try each in order . it will choose the first . provider that is usable . for example , if you configure hyper-v , it . will never be chosen on mac this way . it must be both configured . and usable . vagrant will go through all installed provider plugins ( including . the ones that come with vagrant ) , and find the first plugin that . reports it is usable . there is a priority system here : systems that . are known better have a higher priority than systems that are . worse . for example , if you have the vmware provider installed , it . will always take priority over virtualbox . if vagrant still has not found any usable providers , it will error . this pull request adds vagrant_preferred_providers which is a comma-separated ordered list of preferred providers . if the environment variable is unset , then the code works exactly as before . however if the variable is set , then it implies two additional steps in the algorithm : . 2.5. vagrant will go through all of the config.vm.provider calls in . the vagrantfile and try each in order . it will choose the first . provider that is usable and listed in vagrant_preferred_providers . 3.5. vagrant will go through vagrant_preferred_providers and find the . first plugin that reports it is usable . the individual commits in this pr are as follows : . rewrite environmentdefault_provider to implement vagrant 's existing algorithm in a more straightforward manner . the existing code does math to recalculate priorities and finally sort based on them , but that approach does n't lend itself to an easy comparison between the algorithm and the code , and it 's hard to update the code for tweaks to the algorithm . the new code tries to smooth this out . add support for vagrant_preferred_providers . because of the changes in the first commit , this is very straightforward . add new tests for the new functionality . this is in a separate commit so it 's clear that the existing ( and extensive ) tests continued to work unmodified . in general , i think this pr sheds light on the existing questionable approach to provider priorities . with the existing setup , provider plugins have to be aware of their own place in the pecking order , creating an implicit coupling between plugins , and making it hard for a user or distro ( or vagrant ) to change priorities except by patching the provider plugins . i 'm not sure that vagrant_preferred_providers is the perfect solution , but it seems to work well for this purpose .

"traefik/traefik_4716","throttle kubernetes config refresh","throttle kubernetes config refresh [sep] ? this is an in-progress change to throttle how frequently we refresh the kubernetes ingress configuration . this is n't ready to merge ; i wanted to start a discussion about the approach and share my results testing this change in my production environment . my team is in the process of moving from the nginx ingress controller to traefik . overall , it 's been going well but we saw concerningly high cpu usage from traefik . we 're not handling very much traffic , but each of our 0 traefik pods was using around 0 millicores , with spikes up to sha millicores . for reference , our nginx pods were using around 40 0 millicores for a heaver traffic load . our cluster is roughly 0 nodes , but we 're running many more independent services than is typical for a kubernetes cluster -- we have about 0 ingresses and 0 services . i took a pprof of the traefik process : . i noticed that most of the time was spent loading the configuration from kubernetes and diffing it with the current configuration . if i understand correctly , traefik throttles these updates after they 've been sent from the kubernetes provider to server_configuration.go -- so when we get a lot of updates from kubernetes , traefik spends a lot of time generating and diffing configurations that are then immediately discarded by the throttler . the pr is a first stab at also throttling in the kubernetes provider . we 've deployed this branch to our production environment , with a 10-second throttle , and observed that our cpu usage has declined to roughly 0 millicores ( almost a 10x improvement ) . here 's the pprof after applying this pr : . even throttled that heavily , you can see that we 're still spending most of our time refreshing the kubernetes config , but it 's definitely a big improvement . i think there 's a lot of additional performance that could be squeezed out of the code that refreshes the config , but starting with this throttling is a good first step . open questions . is this approach generally reasonable ? how should we configure the throttling ? i think the ideal thing would be to use the same throttle configuration as server_configuration.go , but i do n't think that config value is passed down to the kubernetes provider . are there other low-hanging performance improvements we could make to improve performance in clusters with a large number of ingresses , services , and endpoints ? i 've been working on top of the v1 0 branch because i wanted to test this in our production environment -- is this something that can make it into the v1 0 branch or should i work against the master branch ?

( ) = > foo ; . bar ; . } . the minimum configuration to reproduce this bug is . { . `` plugins '' : [ `` transform-block-scoping '' , [ `` proposal-object-rest-spread '' , { `` loose '' : true } ] ] . } . note that the plugin order matters here . theoretically a loose approximation of this configuration would be a two-pass transformation : first transform with transform-block-scoping and then transform the intermediate result with proposal-object-rest-spread . the babel repl works good on two-pass transformation , which means there must be something wrong after the block-scoping transforms . something that does not touch the syntax but the abstract metadata . babel/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread/src/index.js . lines 0 to 0 . in . sha . if ( . path.scope.getbinding ( bindingname ) .references > zero_refs || . ! bindingparentpath.isobjectproperty ( ) . ) { . in the removeunusedexcludekeys function that is invoked only in loose mode . this routine will lookup the binding informations of the objectpattern { foo , ... bar } in the for-of statements . for unknown reasons the binding informations are corrupted so exception is thrown . the block-scoping transform will try to wrap the loop body into a closure once a let reference is used inside a function expressions in the loop body . which means . for ( const { foo , ... bar } of { } ) { . ( ) = > foo ; . bar ; . } . will be transformed to . var _loop = function ( foo , bar ) { . ( ) = > foo ; . bar ; . } ; . for ( var { foo , ... bar } of qux ) { . _loop ( foo , bar ) ; . } . since foo is inside an arrow function expression . however , the block-scoping transform incorrectly removes the binding after the loop body is wrapped -- maybe because we tend to feel it is useless since the whole loop body is wrapped in a new scope . this operation creates dichotomy between the actual code and the abstract syntax tree : the variable declarator is still in our code while its binding information is removed . this error has been hidden for a while until it is luckily detected by object-rest-spread loose mode , which tries to manipulate the code according to the binding information . in the end , the fix is pretty straightforward : do not remove the binding information and always synchronize code with ast .

"osquery/osquery_6753","support tls client certificate chains","fixes - support tls client cert chains [sep] this pr switches the openssl call used to load the client cert file into the context to use one which allows specifying a pem cert chain rather than just a single-cert pem file . this allows use of client certs that are issued from intermediate cas ( as are widely deployed in our infrastructure ) . the existing code assumes that the client cert will chain directly up to the server 's trusted root ca , which is incorrect as tls allows for either peer to supply a cert chain and the root ca should be all that is necessary to verify the supplied chain . this pr changes from calling use_certificate_file to use_certificate_chain_file , which is compatible with use_certificate_file with the exception that use_certificate_file allows the caller to specify that the file is in asn 0 format rather than pem . however , osquery has the format argument hardcoded to pem , which means that as osquery uses it , this call is a compatible replacement .

"symfony/symfony_40449","add tailwindcss form layout","[ twigbridge ] add tailwindcss form layout [sep] q . a . branch ? 5.x . bug fix ? no . new feature ? yes . deprecations ? no . tickets . n/a . license . mit . doc pr . todo . it 's been tricky to create a generic form layout for tailwind as it 's a css utility framework and has an unlimited number of ways to style forms . with tailwindcss 2.0 , the tailwind team released an official form plugin that provides form element reset/normalization that looks decent out of the box . this pr is an attempt to piggy-back on this plugin to provide a minimal symfony form layout for tailwind . the goal is to have your forms look good in a tailwind/symfony app with no customization ( but of course allow customization as desired ) . this layout requires tailwindcss 0 and the form plugin . i followed the `` unstyled '' demo for the form plugin as a style guide . here is a screenshot of this layout used in a demo symfony app with several common form types ( i 'll try to keep this updated as i update the pr ) : . some notes about the layout : . i tried to use as few tailwind classes as possible and avoid color ( primary exception being the error color ) . i decided on a mobile-first approach so out of the box , it will look decent on any device and drastically reduces the number of css classes/assumptions . while other layouts merge classes passed by the user , i opted to replace . this ensures the user does n't have to undo the class decisions made by this layout . i also discovered `` undoing '' does n't work as i expected anyway : class= '' mt 0 mt-0 '' , mt 0 `` wins '' as mt 0 comes later in the compiled stylesheet . for the low level blocks , i extracted the classes into their own `` variables '' ( row_class , widget_class , label_class , help_class , error_item_class ) to make it easier to extend and customize the layout . note the widget_disabled_class/widget_errors_class variables : these are added even if you 've overridden the widget_class variable . customization . customizing is especially important for this layout . here are the two ways : . twig form functions : . { { form_row ( form.title , { . row_class : 'my row classes ' , . label_class : 'my label classes ' , . error_item_class : 'my error item classes ' , . widget_class : 'my widget classes ' , . widget_disabled_class : 'my disabled widget classes ' , . widget_errors_class : 'my widget with error classes ' , . } ) } } . project specific form layout : . { % use 'tailwind_2_layout.html.twig ' % } . { % - block form_row - % } . { % - set row_class = row_class|default ( 'my row classes ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock form_row - % } . { % - block widget_attributes - % } . { % - set widget_class = widget_class|default ( 'my widget classes ' ) - % } . { % - set widget_disabled_class = widget_disabled_class|default ( 'my disabled widget classes ' ) - % } . { % - set widget_errors_class = widget_errors_class|default ( 'my widget with error classes ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock widget_attributes - % } . { % - block form_label - % } . { % - set label_class = label_class|default ( 'my label classes ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock form_label - % } . { % - block form_help - % } . { % - set help_class = help_class|default ( 'my label classes ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock form_help - % } . { % - block form_errors - % } . { % - set error_item_class = error_item_class|default ( 'my error item classes ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock form_errors - % } . customization poc/demo . with this custom form theme : . { % - block form_label - % } . { % - set label_class = label_class|default ( 'block text-gray 0 uppercase tracking-wider text-sm font-bold ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock - % } . { % - block widget_attributes - % } . { % - set widget_class = widget_class|default ( 'mt 0 block w-full rounded-md border-gray 0 shadow-sm focus : border-indigo 0 focus : ring focus : ring-indigo 0 focus : ring-opacity-50 ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock - % } . { % - block checkbox_widget - % } . { % - set widget_class = widget_class|default ( 'mr 0 rounded border-gray 0 text-indigo 0 shadow-sm focus : border-indigo 0 focus : ring focus : ring-offset 0 focus : ring-indigo 0 focus : ring-opacity-50 ' ) - % } . { { - parent ( ) - } } . { % - endblock - % } . { % - block checkbox_label - % } . { % - set label_class = label_class|default ( 'block text-gray-800 ' ) - % } . { { - block ( 'form_label ' ) - } } . { % - endblock - % } . the above example looks like this : .

-- ... -- > . < /div > . < div class= '' bg-black bg-white '' > . < ! -- ... -- > . < /div > . both of these div elements will have a white background color , because the order of classes in the html does not matter . what matters is the order of the rules in the stylesheet ( and specificity , but that 's not relevant to this example ) . so following that , this input css : . .foo { . . .bar { . . ... needs to generate this output : . .foo { . background-color : black ; . background-color : white ; . } . .bar { . background-color : black ; . background-color : white ; . } . the shadow lookup table is merged with the user 's css , not treated as a fallback . in this pr , the shadow lookup table still exists to support this use case , but because you can apply classes that appear in multiple rules , we prepend the lookup table to your custom css . this means it is not treated as a fallback , and will always be considered , even if tailwind finds the class you are trying to apply in your custom css . consider this weird situation that you better not be doing you animal : . < ! -- some vue component -- > . < template > . < ! -- ... -- > . < /template > . < style > . .pt 0 { . background-color : lol ; . } . .foo { . . < /style > . in tailwind currently , this would compile to this css output : . .pt 0 { . background-color : lol ; . } . .foo { . background-color : lol ; . } . this is because when tailwind tried to find pt-4 , it found your custom version of it and used that . it does n't consider the default pt 0 unless it ca n't find pt 0 in your own css . in this pr , you 'd get this output : . .pt 0 { . background-color : lol ; . } . .foo { . padding-top : 1rem ; . background-color : lol ; . } . odds of this affecting you are basically zero , but it 's a different mental model so worth explaining . related , tailwind only prepends the shadow lookup if it can not find evidence of tailwind 's styles existing in your css tree . consider this input : . .foo { . background-color : red ; . text-align : center ; . } . this pr generates this output : . .foo { . background-color : red ; . color : white ; . font-weight : normal ; . } . .foo : hover { . font-weight : bold ; . } . .foo { . text-align : center ; . } . seem a little confusing ? think about it in expanded form : . .foo { . background-color : red ; . } . .foo { . color : white ; . font-weight : normal ; . } . .foo : hover { . font-weight : bold ; . } . .foo { . text-align : center ; . } . this is a weird one because it sort of breaks the guiding principle , and you could argue that the applied declarations should be added relative to the source order of the class you are applying into , but after a bunch of trial and error , this felt the most intuitive to us . breaking changes . they will affect very few people . applied classes now follow source order . in tailwind currently , things work like this : . / input / . .foo { . . .bar { . . / output / . .foo { . background-color : white ; . background-color : black ; . } . .bar { . background-color : black ; . background-color : white ; . } . with this pr , things will work like this : . / input / . .foo { . . .bar { . . / output / . .foo { . background-color : black ; . background-color : white ; . } . .bar { . background-color : black ; . background-color : white ; . } . when migrating to this new implementation , you will need to be careful that you were not relying on the old behavior . in practice it is very unlikely you actually depended on this behavior anyways , you would almost never apply two classes that targeted the same css property , and if you did it would be situations like this : . .foo { . . ... which you would have had to explicitly put in that order to get it to work , and tailwind uses that order out of the box . ca n't apply utilities without your configured prefix . .foo { . . previously this was optional , but now because tailwind supports applying classes that appear in multiple rules , it 's impossible for this behavior to not be ambiguous so we are removing it as a result . it breaks the guiding principle anyways , as using unprefixed classes in your html does not work if you have the prefix configured . using a leading dot in front of utilities is no longer supported . this no longer works with the new implementation : . .foo { . . we can make this work if there 's some really good reason , but it has n't been documented for like two years . no good reason to support both syntaxes . .foo { . . / input / . .foo { . . / output / . .foo { . text-align : center ; . } . that proposal is deprecated and that feature will never exist now , so we have removed interop support . faq . the most common question i 've seen so far is `` why are n't declarations with the same selector being grouped together ? '' in situations like this : . / input / . .foo { . . / output / . .foo { . font-weight : normal ; . } . .foo : hover { . font-weight : bold ; . } . .foo { . color : white ; . } . .foo : hover { . color : black ; . } . the simple answer is that this is the only way to make the applied class order match the css source order , because that is the order those rules appear in the css . it 's true that it is safe to optimize this in this case and collapse them , because there are no conflicting properties , but i consider this to be outside the scope of tailwind itself . use cssnano or cleancss for this , you should be using one of them for your production builds anyways and they are very smart dedicated tools that handle this beautifully . release strategy . because this includes breaking changes it is slated for tailwind 2.0 , but will be available to try as an experimental feature in the next release under the applycomplexclasses key : . // tailwind.config.js . module.exports = { . experimental : { . applycomplexclasses : true , . } , . } . we will release it as experimental for now so we can make changes if necessary once it 's out in the wild and people can provide feedback , then we will promote it to future when it is stable , and finally turn it on by default in tailwind 2.0 .

"MarlinFirmware/Marlin_7459","add xon/xoff serial handshaking for faster transfers to sd","[ 1.1.x ] xon/xoff serial handshake ( for faster transfers to sd ) [sep] this patch is trying to improve on the quite slow transfers to the sd card from the host pc . right now , the situation is that we need to wait for the `` ok '' token on the host for each sent line , otherwise , marlin will eventually start dropping characters , as it is unable to follow at the speed the characters are being sent by the host . the problem boils down to several unavoidable delays ( processing time for each line , sd card writing time , etc . it is necesary from the host side to wait until each line is actually processed and acknowledged by the firmware by sending the `` ok '' word . but when using usb connections , there is a polling time or 0 millisecond or even more that is being used by the usb bus to query if there is any new character waiting to be received by the host : this behaviour is part of the usb specification and it is unavoidable , so , we are limited to a maximum of 0 lines per second , or even much less if the usb to serial adapter is using 0 milliseconds as a poll time ( quite typical ) . this means the maximum transfer speed , assuming 0 characters per line , is about 20kbytes/second . the best solution for this would be not to wait for any `` ok '' and use a software handshake to just tell the host when to stop sending data and when to resume sending data . that is exactly the idea we have implemented : we implemented the xon/xoff protocol , but only for reception on the marlin side , so the firmare will be able to tell the pc when to stop and when to resume transmission to avoid buffer overruns on the marlin side . this patch is unobstrusive : the pc is free to ignore the xon/xoff characters and use the previous `` wait for ok '' . the xon/xoff thresholds are high enough that under no circumpstances will be sent if using the `` wait for ok '' protocol . i have also implemented 0 extra features useful for debugging ( that can be disabled if not wanted ) : count of dropped received characters and maximum usage of rx queue . also there are slight improvements to the rx isr to save several cycles . let 's go in order : . added a new macro ispowerof2 ( ) to macros.h to determine if a given number is a power of 0 ( useful for tests ) . added new configurations : serial_stats_dropped_rx , serial_stats_max_rx_queued , serial_xon_xoff . added to possibility to expand rx fifo up to 0 bytes . depending on maximum buffer size , we will now use 16indices or the original 0 bit indices for head and tail on the circular buffer . refactored a bit the rx isr : now the function store_char ( ) reads the usart rx register , instead of sending it as a parameter . this saves several cycles at the isr . also removed the critical section , as the isr is being executed with interrupts disabled , so there is no need to redisable them . saves 0 extra cycles . implemented the xon/xoff protocol with several optimizations . small improvements to the serial parser : instead of calling serial : :available ( ) and then serial : :read ( ) , we just call serial : :read ( ) , as it returns 0 if no character was available . this saves about 0 cycles per processed character . there are some config values checking : according to my tests , using a ch430 usb to serial adapter , and an atmega2560 running at 16mhz , we need a 0 rx buffer size to avoid drops . using sha as baudrate , and the xon/xoff protocol , i was able to transfer 100kbytes/second to a sd card , with no drops at all . slower baudrates also work with no issues at all . [sep] adding a new macro to be able to determine if a given integer value is a power of 2.adding separate rx_buffer_size configuration setting and proper documentation on its usage.adding xon/xoff and statistics configuration settings and proper documentation on their usage for serial port.enforcing requirements so xon/xoff software handshake works and no drops of data are experienced while transferring data to an sd card . i tested this with a ch340 usb to serial adapter ( quite typical ) at baudrates as high as sha on a atmega2560 running at 16mhz , with no problems at all . we need a 0 byte rx buffer . xon/xoff changes.pr : improvement.pr : new feature ."

"rubocop/rubocop_7868","` cop : :base ` is the new recommended base class for cops .","improving auto correction 's api [sep] i am writing my first cop and i feel the current autocorrect api could be improved . this pr is just a demo and not meant for merging . a few cops were refactored using the proposed api . when to specify corrections . my main observation is that the very best moment to do an autocorrection is when the offense is detected . currently the autocorrection and the offense detection are ( officially ) decoupled . when an offense is detected , we know exactly what it is ( location , type , etc . ) yet we are unable to make the correction there and then . when we are later asked to make the autocorrection , we are passed the offending `` node '' . all the state that we might have created to analyze the offense has to be rebuilt at that point , and if we detect different style of offenses , we even have to deduct again which offense this is and correct accordingly . current workarounds . some cops simply redo the detection work twice . this works only provided that each autocorrect calls are made after each add_offense . also , a naive approach would n't work reliably : . def auto_correct ( node ) . lambda do |corrector| . end . end . overly complex de-dupping . the processing currently has two de-duping being done . firstly , extra offenses on the same range are ignored . i can see how this could be useful for certain cops . secondly , if offenses are on different ranges but the same node , the autocorrector is called only for the first one . the only builtin cop that uses this one is spaceinsidereferencebrackets : it will add one or two offenses on the opening ' [ ' and/or closing ' ] ' , and autocorrect will correct the node ( detecting again which of the opening or closing brackets need to be corrected ) and relies on the dedupping not to double-correct if both the opening and closing brackets were wrong . clearly , this is an example where this de-dupping is n't needed but instead the correction should be specifiable when detected ... that dedupping is the only reason i can see why the api of add_offense officially asks for a node and optionally a location . there 's no good reason why an offenses would be attached to a node rather than a range . indeed a few pass a range instead ( like emptylineaftermagiccomment ) and cheat by repeating location : < same location > . i propose that the newer api simply asks for a range ( or node/comment and uses its loc.expression ) and dedupes only on the range . alternative to returning lambdas / false . finally i personally dislike returning lambdas . ruby makes it trivial to capture blocks which feels to me a much more natural way to proceed . it also was n't clear at first that autocorrect can also return false when no correction can be made . this complicates processing a bit ... before you want to autocorrect , you have to check that you can autocorrect . moreover , there is also redundancy and it permits a cop writer to return a lambda that nevertheless would n't make any correction . this trouble should be avoided and deduced automatically . technically the issue is that we would need a way to build the corrections , check if there are any , and only later merge them . in this `` demo '' i use a hack . i simply run the block twice , first on a fake corrector that simply records if it is called and the usual processing will call it later on parser 's treerewriter . the plan would be not to use a hack but i would instead add the merging functionality into treerewriter ( i am its author btw ) . before i spend time doing it though , i 'd like to see if an agreement can reached on the add_offense api . proposed api - simple case . i would propose an improved ( and fully compatible ) api . before : . def on_something ( node ) . ... add_offense ( node ) . end . def auto_correct ( node ) . lambda do |corrector| . corrector.wrap ( node , ' ( ' , ' ) ' ) . end . end . after : . include autocorrector . def on_something ( node ) . ... add_offense ( node ) do |corrector| . corrector.wrap ( node , ' ( ' , ' ) ' ) . end . end . post processing . one complication is that add_offense already yields ( unless the offense is disabled ) for some rare cases where post processing is needed . i noticed that 5 % of the builtin cops use this post processing vs 45 % that do autocorrections ; most with post processing also have autocorrection . there are many solutions to this , but the simple case is simply to use the same block : . before : . def on_something ( node ) . ... add_offense ( node ) do . ... do only if not disabled . end . end . def auto_correct ( node ) . return false unless can_correct_this_one ? ( node ) . lambda do |corrector| . corrector.wrap ( node , ' ( ' , ' ) ' ) . ... end . end . after : . include autocorrector . def on_something ( node ) . ... add_offense ( node ) do |corrector| . ... do only if not disabled . if can_correct_this_one ? ( node ) . corrector.wrap ( node , ' ( ' , ' ) ' ) . ... end . end . compatiblity . what i 'm proposing should be compatible with existing cops . the new api is opt-in for cops that decide to include autocorrector . i 'm proposing that the location : key is n't supported in the new api ( pass the range directly instead of the node in those case ) . it 's not clear to what extent compatibility is required , in particular with copcorrections array . i wrote a correctionsproxy so that corrections could still be used . actually the rest of the code still uses it for now ( team , ... ) , this seemed like a good way to test compatiblity . i intend on cleaning things up though so that the core does n't use copcorrections ...

[sep] guests/arch : change hostname in one command . this commit updates the procedure for changing the hostname on arch . guests to occur in a single command . previously , setting the hostname . and adding the value of the hostname to the /etc/hosts file was done in . two different uploads . this reduces the cycle to a single upload , making . provisioning a bit faster . additionally , this changes the behavior of the /etc/hosts file to : . 1. not remove localhost as an alias of version . 2. prepend our custom hostname before localhost . the resulting /etc/hosts file will look something like : . version my-host.example.com my-host . version localhost.mydomain localhost . tested against ` terrywang/archlinux ` using the following vagrantfile : . `` ` ruby . vagrant.configure ( 2 ) do |config| . config.vm.box = `` terrywang/archlinux '' . config.vm.hostname = `` banana-ramama.example.com '' . config.vm.network `` private_network '' , type : `` dhcp '' . config.vm.network `` private_network '' , ip : `` version `` . config.vm.provision `` file '' , source : `` vagrantfile '' , destination : `` /tmp/vf '' . config.vm.provision `` shell '' , inline : `` echo hi '' . end . `` ` .guests/arch : configure networks in one command . this commit updates the procedure for configuring arch networks to occur . in a single command . previously , each network was configured . independently . if , for some reason , one of the networks destroyed the . ssh connection , the box would be irrecoverable . this commit does not . alleviate that behavior , but attempts to mitigate it by running all . network-related configuration commands in a single communicator ( ssh ) . session . the new procedure looks like this : . 1. upload a temp file to /tmp/vagrant-network-id ... for each interface . on the guest . 2. compile a commands array ( of bash ) to execute after all network . configurations have been uploaded . 3. concatenate all the commands together in a single communicator . session . this was tested against ` terrywant/archlinux ` using the following vagrantfile : . `` ` ruby . vagrant.configure ( 2 ) do |config| . config.vm.box = `` terrywang/archlinux '' . config.vm.hostname = `` banana-ramama.example.com '' . config.vm.network `` private_network '' , type : `` dhcp '' . config.vm.network `` private_network '' , ip : `` version `` . config.vm.provision `` file '' , source : `` vagrantfile '' , destination : `` /tmp/vf '' . config.vm.provision `` shell '' , inline : `` echo hi '' . end . `` ` .guests/arch : do not use sudo when checking hostname . the ` hostname ` command does not require root to execute.guests/arch : use require_relative in plugin defn.guests/atomic : update hostname capability . this commit does a few things : . 1. make the hostname update idempotent with ` grep -w ` . 2. add the given hostname to ` /etc/hosts ` as recommended by the docs . 3. add missing tests.guests/atomic : add tests for docker capability . this commit adds missing test coverage for the docker capability on . atomic guests .. guests/atomic : do not use sudo when checking hostname . the ` hostname ` command does not require root to execute.guests/atomic : use require_relative in plugin defn.guests/coreos : do not use sudo for looking up hostname.guests/coreos : configure networks in one command . this commit configures all the network devices in a single command ."

"netdata/netdata_7376","fixed urlservice bytes decoding and logger unicode encoding in the python.d plugin","do not crash when logging utf 0 data in python 2 [sep] effectively , the response from ntp can sometimes contain utf 0 characters and this would cause the ntp plugin to crash . this is because the message is put through the str function and this is n't expecting utf 0 characters in python 2. however , the debugging should be able to handle utf 0 strings . using the unicode function fixes this issue , but this function has been removed in python 0 because utf 0 is the default and str is sufficient . therefore , i 've added a helper which will try unicode and if it does n't exist , fall back to str . an alternative would be to use future and import future.builtins.str which will mimic python 3 's str function . i did n't proceed with this as it adds a dependency to netdata . logging for python plugins . i could n't see any unit testing for the code i 've changed . if i 've just missed it , let me know and i 'll add tests for what i 've done . to replicate the issue : . spin up a centos 0 vm and install netdata . install ntpd . point ntp at a non-existent ntp server e.g .
