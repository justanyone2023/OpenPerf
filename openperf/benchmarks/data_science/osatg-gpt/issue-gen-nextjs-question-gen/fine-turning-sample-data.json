But as APIs in the App Router evolve, we need a way to make it clearer which features are experimental, stable, or not available in x version, etc. \n\nThat makes sense, but I'd like additional clarification why versioning would impact notes on experimental/stable/etc. I think once you have documentation versioning, it actually minimizes the need for adding those sort of notes into the document. Personally, development intent and direction is not what I expect to see in documentation, but moreso in a dev blog or forum.\n\n> Versioning could solve many of these problems, but I don't have a clear, sustainable long-term implementation yet. Especially when it comes to the maintenance burden / accuracy of older versions - something that's hard to control with open-source docs. \n> \n> But tldr, it's cooking 😊\n\nMaintenance burden is exactly why the community is here to help with extra eyes and pull requests, which is especially made possible and streamlined in _open-source_ documentation. It may be cooking, but we're the epitome of Too Many Chefs 🧑‍🍳\n\nI do think overall the maintenance is becoming increasingly difficult because Next.js team is prioritizing shipping features within minor versions rather than major. Regardless of difficulty, features and breaking changes are _incredibly_ important to be outlined for developers. I don't know if versioning for public-facing documentation is truly an impossible task since they are compiled and versioned already on Github.\n\nI would appreciate if this issue could be remained open  unless the team is already decided on not working on this.", "Prohibiting access to old versions of next.js documents will not accelerate my upgrade to the latest version, it will only make me hope for a replacement.\r\nBecause even if I upgrade to v14 now, once v15 is released, I won't be able to see the documentation for v14 again.\r\nDifficult to understand behavior."], "question": "Docs: Versioned Documentation"}

Thank you.", "Hi @ameer-clara --\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection of the reproduction, it seems like `next-auth` is conflicting with your middleware redirect.\r\n\r\nI was able to get it to work by updating your `signIn` and `signOut` methods as follows:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function login(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {\r\n  // ...existing code\r\n  await signIn('credentials', { redirectTo: '/protected', email, password })\r\n  // ...existing code\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport async function logout() {\r\n  await signOut({ redirectTo: '/' })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what's happening:\r\n\r\n- you submit the sign in form \r\n- the signIn server action from `next-auth` is redirecting to `/` by default when no `redirectTo` is specified ([source](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/93ab5dca6f163bb2112cbca939c5ea829645fabb/packages/next-auth/src/lib/actions.ts#L24))\r\n- importantly: at this point, the router has already received a response from the server, indicating it's on the `/` page.\r\n- Next.js will fire off an intra-app request to `/` since that's what the redirect told it to do, but because the user is now authenticated, your middleware signaled it to instead forward the request to `/protected`\r\n- The signIn request to `/` returns the page data for `/protected`, hence the UI updating, but not the URL.\r\n\r\nI think the right way to fix this is to prevent `next-auth` from redirecting the server action handler to the `/` page, as your intended behavior is to redirect to `/protected`. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as I believe this is behaving as expected, and will separately look into the other linked issues in this thread, as I suspect they're different."], "question": "Redirect URL not updating correctly in browser after successful redirect"}

If you are running into a similar issue, please create a new issue with the steps to reproduce. Thank you.", "Hi @stayclaxxy! This looks to be expected behavior during soft-navigations of parallel routes. You can read a bit more about how that works in [this section](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#active-state-and-navigation) of the parallel routes docs. Specifically:\r\n\r\n> [Soft Navigation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#5-soft-navigation): During client-side navigation, Next.js will perform a [partial render](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering), changing the subpage within the slot, while maintaining the other slot's active subpages, even if they don't match the current URL.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening in your reproduction is that when you arrive on the `/test` page, the `@modal` slot is matched to `default.tsx`. Then when you trigger the interception, the `@modal` slot is matched to `@modal/(.)broken/page.tsx`. Now when you click the close button in your modal, this triggers a soft navigation back to `/test`. It's going to try and find a parallel route at `@modal/page.tsx`. A slot will never go from showing `page` -> `default` (only the reverse is possible). Since it can't find that component, it keeps what was active there before, which in this case was your modal. So your modal component is technically still mounted, but just hidden, because you called `setOpen(false)`. \r\n\r\nTo fix this in your reproduction, you just need to create a `@modal/page.tsx` that returns null. Here's your CodeSandbox forked, with that change: https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/parallel-routes-weird-behavior-forked-kdxmvj\r\n\r\nAlong with a quick demonstration:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/1939140/7c6b727b-f09f-423b-96da-88dda88eea6a\r\n\r\n\r\n"], "question": "router.push not working properly in intercepting modal routes."}

I took a look at the reproduction and it looks like this is the expected behavior. A catch-all route will match all routes except for the \"index\" route that it's defined in. Meaning `/foo`, `/bar`, `/foo/bar`, ...etc, but not `/`. \r\n\r\nWith parallel routes, during a soft navigation (ie when clicking a `Link`) the router will attempt to match the page to a corresponding parallel route. If one doesn't exist, it'll keep whatever was previously in that slot, until you refresh the page. You can learn about that behavior [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#active-state-and-navigation).\r\n\r\nTo get the behavior you're looking for, you can create a `@details/page.tsx` component that returns `null`. That way when the `/` is navigated to, it'll match to this component, where you're telling it to render `null`.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick video after adding that file to your reproduction:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/1939140/fdf7c495-9f5b-46c1-956d-9d45819f3a0a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue but feel free to follow-up with any questions about it!"], "question": "Navigating away from parallel route with router.push() doesn't trigger catch-all"}

Thank you for the report.\r\n\r\nI took a look at the provided reproduction, and I believe the behavior you're seeing is because your `@form` slot doesn't have a root level Page component (ie `@form/page.tsx`). \r\n\r\nWhen you first load the `/` page, since there's no `@form/page.tsx` file, it uses `@form/default.tsx` instead. However, on a soft-navigation (such as when using `redirect(...)` or clicking a `<Link />`), the router's behavior is to try and match a Page component on the requested URL. If it can't find one, it will keep around whatever was previously rendered. We fixed a fair number of parallel routes bugs in 14.2, so it's quite possible the behavior was incorrectly working previously.\r\n\r\nHere's a video where I took your reproduction and added a `@form/page.tsx` component that just renders `null`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/1939140/ecc223bd-8653-4706-b98c-53214175f184\r\n\r\nMore about this behavior can be found [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#active-state-and-navigation).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you're not able to get this to work and I can re-open this issue.

Web developers must manually ensure such elements have their functionality suppressed when exposed to the disabled state.\n\nI don't disagree that the `disabled` attribute is more common/familiar and likely easier for the examples because it gives intended behaviour.

If you are running into a similar issue, please create a new issue with the steps to reproduce. Thank you.", "We cannot recreate the issue with the provided information. **Please add a reproduction in order for us to be able to investigate.**\n\n### Why was this issue marked with the `please add a complete reproduction` label?\n\nTo be able to investigate, we need access to a reproduction to identify what triggered the issue. We prefer a link to a public GitHub repository ([template for App Router](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template), [template for Pages Router](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages)), but you can also use these templates: [CodeSandbox: App Router](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) or [CodeSandbox: Pages Router](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages).\n\nTo make sure the issue is resolved as quickly as possible, please make sure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible. This means that you should **remove unnecessary code, files, and dependencies** that do not contribute to the issue. Ensure your reproduction does not depend on secrets, 3rd party registries, private dependencies, or any other data that cannot be made public. Avoid a reproduction including a whole monorepo (unless relevant to the issue). The easier it is to reproduce the issue, the quicker we can help.\n\nPlease test your reproduction against the latest version of Next.js (`next@canary`) to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n\nIf you cannot create a clean reproduction, another way you can help the maintainers' job is to pinpoint the `canary` version of `next` that introduced the issue. Check out our [releases](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases), and try to find the first `canary` release that introduced the issue. This will help us narrow down the scope of the issue, and possibly point to the PR/code change that introduced it. You can install a specific version of `next` by running `npm install next@<version>`.\n\n### I added a link, why was it still marked?\n\nEnsure the link is pointing to a codebase that is accessible (e.g. not a private repository). \"[example.com](http://example.com/)\", \"n/a\", \"will add later\", etc. are not acceptable links -- we need to see a public codebase. See the above section for accepted links.\n\n### What happens if I don't provide a sufficient minimal reproduction?\n\nIssues with the `please add a complete reproduction` label that receives no meaningful activity (e.g. new comments with a reproduction link) are automatically closed and locked after 30 days.\n\nIf your issue has _not_ been resolved in that time and it has been closed/locked, please open a new issue with the required reproduction.\n\n### I did not open this issue, but it is relevant to me, what can I do to help?\n\nAnyone experiencing the same issue is welcome to provide a minimal reproduction following the above steps. Furthermore, you can upvote the issue using the :+1: reaction on the topmost comment (please **do not** comment \"I have the same issue\" without reproduction steps). Then, we can sort issues by votes to prioritize.\n\n### I think my reproduction is good enough, why aren't you looking into it quicker?\n\nWe look into every Next.js issue and constantly monitor open issues for new comments.\n\nHowever, sometimes we might miss one or two due to the popularity/high traffic of the repository. We apologize, and kindly ask you to refrain from tagging core maintainers, as that will usually not result in increased priority.\n\nUpvoting issues to show your interest will help us prioritize and address them as quickly as possible.

Which feels wrong and bug-like.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's currently counter-intuitive, because I expect the params definitions are not shared with all other slots.  Because if they are, the whole \"filesystem routing\" makes less sense. With the current behaviour, whenever you add a route, you need to add the same route for all the slots.\r\nIf the routes of different slots have to match up together, it would make way more sense to just have alternate page files in the structure.\r\n\r\nWhy do we have to do this:\r\n```tree\r\napp-with-slots\r\n├── @mySlot\r\n│   ├── [slug]\r\n│   │   ├── page.tsx\r\n│   │   └── something\r\n│   │       ├── [...segments]\r\n│   │       │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   │       └── page.tsx\r\n│   ├── other\r\n│   │   ├── [id]\r\n│   │   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   │   ├── more-nesting\r\n│   │   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   └── page.tsx\r\n├── [slug]\r\n│   ├── page.tsx\r\n│   └── something\r\n│       ├── [...segments]\r\n│       │   └── page.tsx\r\n│       └── page.tsx\r\n├── other\r\n│   ├── [id]\r\n│   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   ├── more-nesting\r\n│   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   └── page.tsx\r\n└── page.tsx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we could just do this (since the folders have to match anyways...)\r\n```tree\r\napp-with-slots-2\r\n├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n├── [slug]\r\n│   ├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n│   ├── page.tsx\r\n│   └── something\r\n│       ├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n│       ├── [...segments]\r\n│       │   ├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n│       │   └── page.tsx\r\n│       └── page.tsx\r\n├── other\r\n│   ├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n│   ├── [id]\r\n│   │   ├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n│   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   ├── more-nesting\r\n│   │   ├── @mySlot-page.tsx\r\n│   │   └── page.tsx\r\n│   └── page.tsx\r\n└── page.tsx\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor me, the first approach only really makes sense, if I can independently define params in each slot."], "question": "Dynamic segment parallel route does not match static normal route"}

Coordinate with the target website: If you have the appropriate permissions and are legitimately embedding content from the target website, you can contact the administrators of the target website and request to add your webpage to the whitelist in their CSP.\r\n2. Use a backend proxy: Proxy the requests for the target PDF file through your own server and pass the proxy's result to your frontend. This way, the target website won't be directly loaded in the iframe, and the request will be made from your domain, bypassing the CSP restrictions of the target website.\r\nKeep in mind that the second solution requires server-side configuration and handling.\r\n\r\nIn Next.js, you can resolve the issue by configuring `rewrites` in `next.config.js.`\r\n```ts\r\n// next.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  async rewrites() {\r\n    return [\r\n      {\r\n        source: '/bseindia/:path*',\r\n        destination: 'https://www.bseindia.com/:path*',\r\n      },\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\npage.tsx: `https://www.bseindia.com` => `/bseindia`\r\n```diff\r\nexport default function Home() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <iframe\r\n      src={\r\n+        \"/bseindia/bseplus/AnnualReport/532540/68468532540_25_05_21.pdf\"\r\n-       \"https://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/AnnualReport/532540/68468532540_25_05_21.pdf\"\r\n      }\r\n    ></iframe>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"], "question": "Not able to load remote pdf in nextjs"}

Sometimes, you expect errors related to async/await, but you're not always getting them.\r\n\r\nHere's why:\r\n\r\n1. **Client vs. Server Execution**: The `StoreProvider` is for the client side, and it doesn't directly deal with async/await in server-side code. Async/await issues are usually more relevant on the server side.\r\n\r\n2. **Async on the Server**: When you use `async` in `UniversityPage`, it tells Next.js that this component might involve server-side logic during the initial request. However, Next.js might decide to run it on the client side for subsequent navigations if there are no specific data fetching requirements.\r\n\r\n3. **Client-Side Behavior**: If `UniversityPage` runs on the client side, async/await may not always cause errors. It depends on various factors like timing and conditions during client-side execution.\r\n\r\nFor consistent server-side execution and to catch potential async/await issues, you can use Next.js data fetching methods like `getServerSideProps`. This ensures that data fetching happens on the server side during the initial request, helping to avoid inconsistencies between client and server execution."], "question": "Bug using async/await in child component while parent has 'use client'"}

I [just made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBlSe8tvg4U) walking through caching that hopefully will help explain a little bit more. In the instance of the example you provided, a couple things I wanted to mention.\r\n\r\nFirst, rather than using the route segment config options, prefer to use functions like `noStore()` or `cookies()` / `headers()` etc for opt-ing the page into dynamic rendering. This is more commonly how your application will be structured – e.g. this can be a nested component, not necessarily at the top level of the page or layout.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport Link from 'next/link';\r\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';\r\n\r\nexport default function Page() {\r\n  noStore();\r\n  return (\r\n    <main>\r\n      <h1>A: {Date.now()}</h1>\r\n      <Link href=\"/\">Back</Link>\r\n    </main>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, if you want to see a new date value on transition here, you can use `<a>` instead:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default function Home() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <main>\r\n      <section>\r\n        <a href=\"/test\">Test</a>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </main>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand the date example is commonly used to try and reason about how the system works (that's what I used in my video, too!) but more commonly, there will be some change to your underlying data (whether that's a `fetch` or some database call that you wrap with `unstable_cache`) and you'd use the Next.js APIs to invalidate the cache (`revalidateTag` and `revalidatePath`) which would ensure that new data is fresh on the page transition. Hope this helps! And as mentioned above, there's a [bunch more detail here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/54075), as well as the docs, and we're exploring some further options to customize caching."], "question": "Next App Router Revalidation Issue"}

From my testing, this issue won't immediately appear as soon as an MUI component is used but requires a certain combination of things to trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Workarounds (note that these are NOT solutions)**\r\n\r\n1. Instead of using named import in RSC, use default import, i.e.\r\n    ```diff\r\n    - import { Typography } '@mui/material';\r\n    + import Typography '@mui/material/Typography' ;\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Why this works. Because we are essentially NOT using `optimizePackageImports` here since we are no longer importing components from the barrel file.\r\n2. Make all components that use MUI components Client Components, i.e.\r\n    ```diff\r\n    + 'use client';\r\n    import { Typography } '@mui/material';\r\n    ```\r\n    Why this works. Because yet again, we are NOT using optimizePackageImports here.

I attempted to address this issue by making additional commits to the repository. The problem stemmed from my misunderstanding of how to set up a parallel route for all nested routes. While collaborating with @SidKH, we found out the issue was because I had not set a default.tsx for the parallel route in the first commit so when changing the URL with a hard refresh, it shows a 404 error. @SidKH suggested importing the header from @header/page.tsx to @header/default.tsx and putting it in a suspense boundary because 'default.tsx' doesn't pick up a 'loading.tsx' as a Suspense boundary.

If you are running into a similar issue, please create a new issue with the steps to reproduce. Thank you.", "Hey there. I've faced the same \"issue\".\r\nI had following app structure:\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n  (default)/\r\n    layout.tsx\r\n    page.tsx\r\n    folder/...\r\n  (simple)/\r\n    layout.tsx\r\n    campaign/...\r\n```\r\nAnd tried to make a default 404 page with layout from one of my groups.\r\nWorkaround I've came up was this:\r\n\r\n1. Create root layout (you need this to prevent getting `\"not-found.tsx doesn't have a root layout. To fix this error, make sure every page has a root layout.\"`). It can be as simple as:\r\n```tsx\r\n// src/app/layout.tsx\r\n\r\nexport default function RootLayout({\r\n  children,\r\n}: {\r\n  children: React.ReactNode;\r\n}) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <html lang=\"en\" >\r\n      <body>\r\n        {children}\r\n      </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Edit old layouts by removing their base and just leaving `React.Fragment`:\r\n```tsx\r\n// src/app/(default)/layout.tsx\r\n\r\nexport default function RootLayout({\r\n  children,\r\n}: {\r\n  children: React.ReactNode;\r\n}) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <Navigation />\r\n      {children}\r\n      <Footer />\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Create `not-found` handler by using layout from (default) group\r\n```tsx\r\n// src/app/not-found.tsx\r\n\r\nimport Layout from './(default)/layout';\r\n\r\nexport default function NotFound() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Layout>\r\n      <h1>My 404</h1>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis did the trick for me\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSure it would be nicer to not use such work arounds. Next.js could match `not-found` the same way it does when you have your root page.tsx placed under some group (Like `src/app/(default)/page.tsx`)"], "question": "[Bug] Not found not working with Route groups"}

Thank you.", "An update on this – did a bit more investigation and I think there's a bit of additional information that may be helpful\r\n\r\n1. **Inline scripts _are_ actually working, Chrome just hides the nonce in the browser console.**\r\nFor all of Next's inline scripts, it looks like the nonce is actually being correctly added, it just shows up as `nonce=\"\"` in the browser console (presumably for security or readability measures). You can confirm the nonce has been added by selecting an element, and then selecting \"Properties\" from the Styles, Computed, Layout tabs.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"752\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/51107902/2468a47f-db3e-44e8-a335-7fbfb4ca3ca7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Part of the issue is due to Vercel's edge runtime.**\r\nThis behaviour happens in development (`npm run dev`) and local builds (`npm run build`, `npm run start`). The nonce attribute does not seem to be added at all when deployed to Vercel using the edge runtime `export const runtime = 'edge'`. The page fails to load correctly and all scripts, inline or 3rd party, are rejected by the CSP.\r\n\r\n3. **`next/script` tags using `afterInteractive` appear to be initially rendered without the nonce, but then hydrated(?) with the nonce**\r\nOne issue currently is that `<Script>` components with a 3rd party js `src` are still logging errors to console, claiming that the script load was blocked due to CSP. From what I can tell, this appears to be due to the fact that the `<script>` tag is being created initially without the nonce, and then the nonce is added later, causing the script to be re-fetched. You can verify this in the browser devtools in the network tab - you should see the script being tried once with a CSP error and then a second time with a 200. For me, this is causing issues with analytics tools working properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome possible temporary fixes include:\r\n- Disable `edge` runtime and use `nodejs` instead\r\n- Remove nonces from the CSP and use a domain allowlist + `unsafe-inline` for now\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to get some insight on why the nonce is not being initially added with the `<script>` tag when using `afterInteractive`."], "question": "CSP nonce not being added to inline scripts"}

I'm trying to **automatically generate the `title` property for all routes in `generateMetadata` based on the page's URL.** \r\nThe idea is to extract the URL from `headers()` (or maybe the Request object), then do some string manipulation to turn the string **`www.example.com/home/dashboard`** into the `title` becoming **`Home › Dashboard`**.\r\n\r\n`generateMetadata` **only receives the params for dynamic routes**, which, while useful, does not work with static routes.\r\n`export const metdata` also doesn't work as well as it has to be added to every single page in the app, which is a huge annoyance for apps with hundreds/thousands of pages.\r\n\r\nThe workaround that  [@jmacbhc suggested](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/50189#discussioncomment-6597167) is utilizing `headers()` and accessing the `x-invoke-path` property to get the path. **This solution doesn't work when deploying on Vercel.**\r\n\r\n**The solution to this issue is basically an equivalent of `usePathname()` that can work in Server Components.**\r\n\r\n"], "question": "`x-invoke-path` doesn't exist on `headers()` when running on Vercel."}

I'm working on a pet project and just starting to tinker with my Dockerfile configurations. I have a very basic setup and hit this error. This is a first draft and I'm sure there are obvious things wrong that don't need discussion here, but the `BUILD_ID` error struck me as pretty odd/confusing and that's how I found this issue\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager\r\nCOPY . .\r\nRUN npm ci\r\nRUN npm run build\r\n\r\nENV NODE_ENV production\r\nENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1\r\nENV PORT 3000\r\nENV HOSTNAME \"0.0.0.0\"\r\n\r\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"start\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run --rm -it <my tag>\r\n\r\n> <my-app>@0.1.0 start\r\n> next start\r\n\r\n- ready started server on [::]:3000, url: http://localhost:3000\r\n[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/.next/BUILD_ID'] {\r\n  errno: -2,\r\n  code: 'ENOENT',\r\n  syscall: 'open',\r\n  path: '/app/.next/BUILD_ID'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems fixed if I put an `npm run build` right after `npm ci`. Seems like ` build` is required along with `start`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM node:20-bookworm-slim\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager\r\nCOPY . .\r\nRUN npm ci\r\nRUN npm run build\r\n\r\nENV NODE_ENV production\r\nENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1\r\nENV PORT 3000\r\nENV HOSTNAME \"0.0.0.0\"\r\n\r\nCMD [\"npm\", \"run\", \"start\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom a distance, it feels weird that if I'm running a Next.js server for production that I also need to explicitly build first :shrug: I guess the docs do call out that a `build` is always required for prod along with `npm run start`:\r\n\r\n> next start starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with [next build](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build) first...\r\n>\r\n> - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#production\r\n\r\n...but it seems like something easy to overlook that the command to `run` in production always requires another command to be run first. Regardless, I then get a different error after adding in the `npm run build`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- ready started server on [::]:3000, url: http://localhost:3000\r\nError: \"next start\" does not work with \"output: export\" configuration.

Use \"npx serve@latest out\" instead.`. I had set `output: 'export',` in `next.config.js` while I was tinkering with different configurations.

In our case we are running our main app on port 8080 and our subzone on 8081.\r\n\r\n- Introduced in 13.4.13-canary-0, likely caused by https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/53029, a frankly enormous refactor introduced in a patch release and mysteriously absent from the release notes, probably due to being a revert of a revert\r\n- Still happens on 13.5.2\r\n- Only happens in dev mode, prod mode works as it did prior to 13.4.13\r\n- In the hmr websocket the final message before the reload is this \r\n     ```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"event\": \"client-full-reload\",\r\n      \"stackTrace\": \"SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', \\\"<!DOCTYPE \\\"... is not valid JSON\",\r\n      \"hadRuntimeError\": false\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    which seems to indicate that the fast refresh isn't hitting the correct route and is getting an index page back.\r\n- At the same time a request is sent to `${otherApp}/${otherAppBasePath}/_next/static/webpack/${hash}.webpack.hot-update.json`. I can't catch the response body, but the headers indeed have `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf8` which is obviously wrong.\r\n- The requested file does not exist, however if I am on the subzone app directly (in our case visiting http://subapp.localhost:8081/zonePath/) when I restart the dev server, another hot-update file is created with a different hash and successfully requested from the server.\r\n\r\nI don't know what goes into the hash, but is it possible that the requested hash is wrong because it's using the port that the web browser is on and not the port that the underlying server is running on?"], "question": "Multi-zone not working on version 13.4.19. 13.4.3 works fine"}

When no comparison function is provided, the sort() method converts the elements of the array to strings and then performs a lexicographic (dictionary-style) sorting.\r\n\r\nIn this case, all the elements in the \"numbers\" array are strings, so they are sorted lexicographically. When lexicographically sorted, \"1000\" comes before \"200\" because \"1\" comes before \"2\" in the character encoding.\r\n\r\nBy providing the comparison function (a, b) => parseInt(a) - parseInt(b), it will ensure that the elements are compared as integers, and thus the sorting will be done numerically.\r\n\r\nI think we should check where this sorting is taking place.

If `default.tsx` does return a component, it will load that in addition to the modal. The server action continues to run like before, but without any errors.

Thank you.", "I think we're currently experiencing this outside of Vercel, in standalone mode where Next is deployed in a Docker container running on Cloud Run (in CPU always allocated configuration with minimum number of instances set to 1 so cold starts should be minimal). There's got to be something else that's causing this - either the number of dependencies or getInitialProps in the custom Document? Could that be the culprit. We are pulling some data but navigating between pages takes 2-4s when clicking a Next Link whereas reloading the page directly takes a lot less time (~1s). We tried the latest Canary release (13.4.20) to no avail. We use Pages Router, not the App Router. This app uses CSS-in-JS (via Emotion) and Mantine UI (+[SSR](https://mantine.dev/guides/ssr/)). We use Next Auth for authentication. This is a fairly complex and robust app and I don't think I'd be able to provide a minimum reproducible example but I can provide a Trace from Chrome and a screenshot that shows `Next.js-render` phase taking over 5s.\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-09-09 at 04 56 37](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/613647/3bb2924b-75f8-42cc-a899-25505f329207)\r\n\r\n[Trace-20230909T045419.json.zip](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/files/12564454/Trace-20230909T045419.json.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n"], "question": "Next/link is very slow sometimes it doesn't work"}
