{"sentences":"### What problem does this feature solve?\nLet me start by saying I love Vue. It is an awesome framework you guys have created, I enjoy using it, and it is at the very top of Frameworks of choice.\n\nBut from day one there has been one small area where I found Vue lacking, this is in the Custom Directives department.\n\nI wasn't around for Vue 1, but from what I can gather a decision was made to \"underpower\" Custom Directives in favor of Components. And I agree, when you are developing applications Components is most likely all you need.\n\nThe problem starts when you want to create plugins, especially UI plugins. I have created UI plugins in other Frameworks, specifically a Bootstrap native implementation, I have several features that are implemented with Custom Directives, I like how clean they are that way. But when I tried to achieve the same thing with Vue, well I got frustrated very quickly.\n\nProblem Number 1: We don't have a Vue instance. I wish we could create Custom Directives the Same way we create Custom Components. so we have an actual Vue Instance and we can use this. Right now you have to manually extract the directive bindings and store them in the in the element itself. It is not clean since I have to pass the el object around to have access to those properties. It is doable but not very clean.\n\nProblem Number 2: The update hook function it is not being called consistently. For instance, I have this: v-myDirective={foo: bar}; when bar changes the update method is not called, only when something in the DOM changes then update is called. This is super frustrating because many times you want to control the state of your directive based off a property value, but you have no consistent way to know if its value has changed. This is a real problem because there are things that cannot be done without a consistent way to know if a binded property has changed. I wish I could have a Vue instance and have watch methods to react to changes accordingly.\n\nI LOVE Vue, it is an awesome framework, I will continue to enjoy using it and to recommend it. But if this is improved I would have absolutely no reason to ever use any other framework.\n\nThanks for the hard work and love that goes into Vue.\n\n### What does the proposed API look like?\nThe API will basically be the same one we have for Custom Components. The example is silly, but I would love to be able to do something like this:\n\n```\nVue.directive('myDirective', {\n  data: {\n    el: null\n  },\n  props: ['foo', 'name'],\n  bind (el, binding, vnode, oldVnode) {\n    this.el = el\n    //Bind\n  },\n  inserted (el, binding, vnode, oldVnode) {\n    //Inserted\n  },\n  unbind (el, binding, vnode, oldVnode) {\n    //Unbind\n  },\n  computed: {\n    name () { return `My name is ${this.name}`}\n  },\n  watch: {\n    name (value) { this.nameUpdated(value)}\n  },\n  methods: {\n    nameUpdated (value) {\n      this.$emit('nameUpdated', value)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

(Allowing the component's handler the first chance to stop propagation)\n- Using this functional component in a parent component, bind a listener to the same event (e.g. `\"click\"`)\n- Execute the event\n\n### What is expected?\n1. The functional component's handler should be called first, since it is first in the array\n2. The functional component's handler should execute the `stopImmediatePropagation` call, and kill the event loop.\n\n### What is actually happening?\n1. Execution order is preserved correctly.\n2. The parent component's handler is still being invoked (but additional handlers bound through `EventTarget.addEventListener` are not).\n\n---\nMy use case starts at creating a link component that will respect a `disabled` property, but continues on to various other components to create a cohesive UI component API.\n\nIt would be beneficial to have some way to cancel the Vue event loop. I don't know my way around the source well enough, but I imagine that Vue internally tracks all event handlers for a given node, intercepts the native event first, then invokes all callbacks. This is why natively bound callbacks do not get invoked, but callbacks bound by Vue are invoked.\n\n<!-- generated by vue-issues. DO NOT REMOVE -->","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"### Problem\n\nThe event system seemed like a useful idea when I first implemented it. It is still very useful internally, but I've found that I almost never use it in my application code because the accidental complexity `$broadcast()` and `$dispatch()` can introduce. Here are some issues:\n1. Their behavior relies on the structure of the component tree. On the surface it decouples the components, but in fact it still couples them quite tightly. Once a event relationship is set up, your components need to stick to that structure; you can accidentally break your event chain by moving the components around.\n2. Namespacing. When you listen to an event, you have no idea if a child component somewhere might dispatch an event with that name and screw things up. You just can't prevent that.\n3. Events are often (ab)used to trigger state changes, but their propagation inside the component tree is very abstract and implicit. Because the events can go both ways, the events flow inside a large application quickly gets very hard to wrap your head around, and it becomes even harder to understand where your app state to change originated from. A lot of times, a simple global event bus can make things centralized and thus a lot easier to understand. (You can even adopt Flux if you want to go further)\n### Proposal\n1. ~~Deprecate `$broadcast()` and `$dispatch()`. Other event methods still remain, which means Vue isntances are still event emitters.~~ Stop propagation by default in `$broadcast()` and `$dispatch()`, unless the user calls the second argument `propagate`.\n2. Expose a global utility so users can construct their own event bus. Something like `new Vue.Emitter()`.\n3. (Outside of core) Investigate recommendation for state management. You can use libraries like [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) or Redux.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

Especially in combination with `v-for` loops, they were a perfect match.\n\nThinking that I'll have to use computed properties to replace the filtering for each and every prop I want, I'm worried that I'll be writing a lot of boilerplate in the future.

{"sentences":"Hi @klehelley and thanks for this detailed reproduction.\n\n### What's going on?\n\nChrome only opens the file picker when the `click()`event's programmatic invocation happened during a user-interaction (i.e. a user clicking a button).\n\nNow on the surface, this is what happens, right? The user clicks \"Add file\", and a file input is added and clicked programmatically. But the issue is that Vue's update mechanism after data changes runs asynchronously. So the call stack of the original \"Add file\" click event has already finished before the new component is created.\n\nTherefore, the `click()` call in the new component's `mounted` hook is not triggered by a user-event, from Chrome's perspective, and consequently is ignored.\n\nYou can see Chrome's behaviour, without Vue and very simplified, here: https://jsfiddle.net/0L794s53/1/\n\n### So how to solve this? \nMy suggestion would be to change the `Files.vue` component. \n\nI would add a hidden file input to *that* component and use it for every new file. After the file has been selected, read it from the input, add it to the file list, and reset the file input.\n\nThat way, the `FileUpload.vue` component itself would never contain an actual file input.\n\nIf that doesn't work for you, because you actually *need* an input per file (I can't think of a reason but you might very well have one), you will have to come up with another way to have the input already in the DOM *before* that button is clicked. maybe always have a \"new\" file in the `this.files` list and hide the last entry until the user selected something, or whatever.\n\n### Closure & Further support\n\nI think this is not something we can solve in Vue internals - the asynchronous update queue is here to stay. Rather, you will have to find ways to work around this, as described above. If you need further help with this, Please join us on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org and we can work this out.","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"(This all assumes that my guess of the cause is correct...)\n\nI don't think this is happening just because of the absolute positioning, I think it's just the _ordering_ of the FLIP calculations and applying the style changes.  If I remove three items in one go, then they collapse towards the location of the first removed item (and only the first will fall directly downwards).\n\nIt seems to me that the FLIP calculation works out the correct animation before applying the absolute positioning, and that works fine -- as long as only a single item is removed!\n\nThis issue is that when two or more items are removed, the calculation fails to correctly calculate the item's end position, and it seems to make sense that the absolute positioning is being applied by the transition-group **as it iterates** through its children -- it seems to make changes to the classes/styles as it goes through the items (when multiple elements are removed), each change affects subsequent items in an unexpected way (so any previous elements in this removal have **already** been removed from the flow before it calculates their end position).  This explains why there is no issue with a single removal, and the problem is only seen when multiple items are removed.\n\nIt would work as the user expects if the transition group firstly calculated the FLIP positions for the removed elements **as they currently stand** (without yet mutating the classes/styles), and **only after doing them all** made any changes to the classes/styles of the elements.  This way, the elements would animate as expected.\n\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

I first tried to use a `String` type uuid of each item as the value for the `:key`, then I encountered the same error this issue mentioned. The situation is similar because the mounted DOM node for this wrapper component got \"tampered\" as required by the Google Maps API, specifically the root node's `position` style property is changed to `absolute`, and `left` and `top` changed to the appropriate ones for them to display on the map correctly based on the item's `lat` and `lng`.\n\nThen I changed to use a POJO `{ location: { lat: <Number>, lng: <Number> } }` as the value for the `:key`, both issues are solved: DOM nodes are updated correctly with underlying array change, and no longer seeing the exception mentioned in this issue `DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.`.\n\nI guess because the `:key` is a POJO, which is an instance of Object, that's not passed around by value (initially I used String), but by reference, helped to work around the issue?","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"Hello Astra-git,\n\nthanks for your report and the provided reproduction fiddle.\n\nDid you provide the correct version of your fiddle? it's missing the exernal vue.js file library and the template for the `test` component (which you nest in itself without a clear reason/relation to the issue) seems unfinished.\n\nI can kind of see what you refer to, but it's not really conclusive.\n\nAnyways, what I  think is happening is that your code kind of gets ahead of itself and runs in a circle:\n- you set the prop `this.parentNumber` to `1`\n- This will trigger the two-way sync and propagate the value to the item in the parent.\n- But you also set `this.item.number` to 0 immediatly afterwards - and you do this on the _original object_, not the `parentNumber` prop.\n\nSo now we have some kind of a race condition: you change a two-way prop which triggers an event to update the parent element, and at the same time you update said parent element dírectly, which should trigger a downwards update of the prop `parentNumber` ...\n\nThe result now depends when which reactive update event fires, beause reactive updates are async:\n- first, the direct update of `this.item.number` succeeds, because this happens synchroneously. the parent object' number property is now `0`\n- only then, after the stack is done, the reactive update to the parent from the two-way prop comes along, changing it to 1,\n- ...and the first change to 0 already triggered a rreactive event downwards, changing the prop `parentNumber` to 0.\n\nThis is a first guess/observation, but the bottom line is, ttwo-way bindings are a bitch to debug, especially when you tinker with both sides of the binding at the same time (if setting to 0 and to 1 is done on `this.parentNumber`, everything behaves normally).\n\nSo I don't think it's a bug, but simply a side-effect of an anti-pattern when working with two-way bindings.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

{"sentences":"Not sure if this is a bug or a misunderstanding of the way timeouts should work.\n\nWhen specifiying a timeout on an observable in combination with a Scheduler to observeOn, the exception exception handling code does not occur on the scheduler but on an RxComputationThread. For an example see the test class below. This has 2 tests which both create an Observable and modify it to observe on a custom scheduler with a single named thread. One throws an exception explicitly and we can see the onError() method being called on the named thread. The second specifies a timeout of 100ms then delays by a second before sending emissions, so causing a TimeoutException - however this exception happens on a computation thread.\n\nIn my production code I'm using JavaFX and am specifying a scheduler that runs on the JavaFX thread so I can update controls and display error popups safely, but if a timeout occurs I'm having to wrap in a  Runnable and call Platform.runLater() which seems to defeat the point. I can't find any explicit documentation on this so not sure whether this is intentional or a bug, or whether I'm using it incorrectly.\n\n**EDIT**: It seems that ordering the timeout() call **before** the observeOn() call has the desired result - is this the way it should be used?\n# \n\n``` java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;\nimport java.util.function.Consumer;\n\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport rx.Observable;\nimport rx.Scheduler;\nimport rx.Subscriber;\nimport rx.schedulers.Schedulers;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\n/**\n * Tests to ensure RxJava events are on the expected threads\n */\npublic class RxJavaThreadTest {\n\n  @Test\n  public void sendValuesAndException() throws InterruptedException {\n    Observable<String> observable = createObservable(this::sendValuesAndThrowable);\n    MySubscriber subscriber = new MySubscriber();\n    observable\n          .observeOn(createNamedScheduler(\"My thread\"))\n          .subscribe(subscriber);\n    subscriber.awaitCompletion();\n\n    assertThat(subscriber.getThrowable()).hasMessage(\"my exception\");\n    assertThat(subscriber.onErrorThreadName()).isEqualTo(\"My thread\");\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void timeout() throws InterruptedException {\n    Observable<String> observable = createObservable(this::sendValuesWithDelay);\n    MySubscriber subscriber = new MySubscriber();\n    observable\n          .observeOn(createNamedScheduler(\"My thread\"))\n          .timeout(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)\n          .subscribe(subscriber);\n    subscriber.awaitCompletion();\n\n    assertThat(subscriber.getThrowable()).isExactlyInstanceOf(TimeoutException.class);\n    assertThat(subscriber.onErrorThreadName()).isEqualTo(\"My thread\");\n  }\n\n  private Scheduler createNamedScheduler(String name) {\n    return Schedulers.from(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(runnable -> new Thread(runnable, name)));\n  }\n\n  private Observable<String> createObservable(Consumer<Subscriber<? super String>> consumer) {\n    return Observable.create(new Observable.OnSubscribe<String>() {\n      @Override\n      public void call(Subscriber<? super String> sub) {\n        consumer.accept(sub);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  private void sendValuesAndThrowable(Subscriber<? super String> sub) {\n    sub.onNext(\"a\");\n    sub.onNext(\"b\");\n    sub.onNext(\"c\");\n    sub.onError(new Exception(\"my exception\"));\n  }\n\n  private void sendValuesWithDelay(Subscriber<? super String> sub) {\n    //Pause for a second before sending data\n    try {\n      Thread.sleep(1000);\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n      //ignore\n    }\n    sub.onNext(\"a\");\n    sub.onNext(\"b\");\n    sub.onNext(\"c\");\n    sub.onCompleted();\n  }\n\n  private static class MySubscriber extends Subscriber<String> {\n\n    private final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);\n    private final List<String> collectedValues = new ArrayList<>();\n    private Throwable throwable = null;\n    private String onErrorThreadName = null;\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCompleted() {\n      latch.countDown();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onError(Throwable throwable) {\n      this.throwable = throwable;\n      this.onErrorThreadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();\n      latch.countDown();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onNext(String value) {\n      collectedValues.add(value);\n    }\n\n    public void awaitCompletion() throws InterruptedException {\n      latch.await();\n    }\n\n    public Throwable getThrowable() {\n      return throwable;\n    }\n\n    public List<String> getCollectedValues() {\n      return Collections.unmodifiableList(collectedValues);\n    }\n\n    public String onErrorThreadName() {\n      return onErrorThreadName;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

{"sentences":"# The Problem:\n\nCreating Back-Pressure Enabled Observables that produce data from a non-blocking source is hard and our current APIs for creating arbitrary observables do not lend towards creating observables that respect the back pressure rules. Users have a choice between calling one of the Observable static method to generate standard case observables using well known patterns or they can attempt to implement a responsible observable out of an `OnSubscribe<T>`. I will define a \"responsible Observable\" to be an observable that does the following:\n- calls `subscriber.onNext(t)` only when the `subscriberCapacity > 0` where `subscriberCapacity` is the sum of the integer arguments for all invocations of `producer.request(n)` minus the number of calls made to `subscriber.onNext(t)`.\n- calls `subscriber.onCompleted()` or `subscriber.onError(e)` only once.\n- does not call `subscriber.onNext(t)` concurrently.\n\nThe onSubscribe lifecycle of a responsible observable should fit within the following lifecycle.\n1. The `onSubscribe.call(Subscriber<T>)` method is invoked by the `Observable.subscribe(Subscriber<T>)` method.\n2. The OnSubscribe func creates a `Producer` via the `subscriber.setProducer(Producer<T>)` method. At some point in the (potentially distant) future the subscriber may call `producer.request(n)`. This signals to the observable that capacity is allocated  in the subscriber.\n   3a. Values are produced via a call to `subscriber.onNext(t)`.\n   3b. At some point a terminal event is emitted via `onCompleted` or `onError`.\n\nThis allows for many different variations of control flow given that onNexts could possibly be scheduled, data could be pre-fetched, excess data could be batched or dropped, etc...\n# Proposal\n\nWith this ground work in mind I would like to start a discussion about a general framework that correctly models the various use cases, particularly with respects to the following requirements:\n- capable of paginating data across multiple requests\n- batching requests\n- hot and cold data sources\n- async and blocking onNexts\n## Naive Implementation\n\nUser provides callbacks that the framework will call between each of the steps above. That is\n1. Observable calls `onSubscribe.call(s)`\n2. The framework's onSubscribe calls: `S dataState = onSubscribeGenerator.call()`\n3. Next the onSubscribe calls: `subscriber.setProducer(p)` setting a framework Producer\n4. At some point the request is received by our producer `p.request(n)`\n5. Then the framework will call the user provided request callback and store the new resultant `dataState` for future requests. `dataState = onRequestCallback.call(dataState, n, s)`\n\nObvious short comings of this approach: Order may not be preserved across multiple requests if the `onRequestCallback` schedules the onNext. Also onNexts may be concurrent so the subscriber must be wrapped with a serializing subscriber. Also, a case could be made that many observables created should specify the backpressure strategy. Any thoughts are welcome. \n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

If the sources are operating on different scheduler, it is quite uncertain as to which scheduler will be used to run the combine function.

{"sentences":"> Why do you consider the following to be a bug, and how does this have anything to do with the groupBy issue?\n\nWhen one subscribes to the pubsub from a different thread it is indeed totally reasonable that he may or may not receive the item that is currently being handled. What I am talking about is the case where one subscribes to the pubsub from the _same_ thread as where the pubsub onNext is being handled. This happens when, in the image, B.onNext(8) will subscribe a new observer D to the pubsub. The question is then whether this D will or will not receive the value 8. As this is all happening in a single thread, there is no need for this action to be unpredictable. The subscription of D is undoubtably happening _after_  pubsub.onNext was called, because it was _caused_ by it. That makes it weird that D only _might_ receive 8 because there is no race condition. It either should or it should not include D in the set of obervers that receive 8, depending on which behaviour you want pubsub to have (as discussed in my last post).\nTo extend the image:\n![publishsubjectissue](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4191409/593119/5f4498ea-ca2f-11e2-8639-5dda6c06e8c8.png)\n\nThe relation to groupBy:\nWhat groupBy does is emitting observables that are descendents of its own source. When using groupBy on a pubsub, when one subscribes to these emitted observables (using nested subscribes or mapMany or whatever), the situation described above occurs (perhaps with some operators between B.onNext and pubsub.subscribe(D)). This results in not knowing whether or not the first item of the group will be received.\n\nI hope my explanation is clear enough, just let me know if it is not or if you find some flaw in my thoughts.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

They're aware of this. If they need a specific scheduler, they should use their own or accept it as a parameter. You could just as easily flip this around to say that library developers then lose the ability to easily defer to the execution environment and now have to add these annoying parameters everywhere to force the user to pass in their instance.

Why can't there be a default?\n\n> Any change of global state in multithreaded runtime is dangerous.\n\nThis statement is far too general and not really valid justification IMO. You should really be specific as to what states you're referring to and why they're dangerous. It seems to me your main issue is with the plugins/hooks API, which I argue farther down is equally as prone to bad developers doing stupid things as non-static APIs are.\n\n> Because of thread-safety required for this global state RxJava has to apply atomic/synchronized operations to access it in many parts of Rx chains lifecycle which degrades performance a little bit.\n\nCan you quantify this? If it's negligible (which I believe it is), then I don't really think it matters. Even if it did, schedulers are already cached and plugins are only set once, so the perf impact largely only affects the first user. The only time this would happen frequently is in tests, where perf is much less of an issue.\n\n> Some parts of hooks done through system properties, some via explicit API, not very consistent.\n\nI think we all agree the current 1.x hook system is not ideal. There is already a new hooks API in 2.x, so I think this is a false comparison.\n\n> RxJava makes multithreading easy and immutability of the data that goes through Rx chains is a must have, but library itself is not immutable, that's awkward because RxJava brings a lot of functional aspects and immutability is fundamental to the concept.\n\nAgain, it's just the hooks and plugins. I would argue these are a small-but-necessary evil to that give RxJava much of its flexibility. \n\n> What I think of is to make RxJava instantiable and remove all shared state between RxJava instances. Just like any other normal library such as Retrofit, Moshi, OkHttp (mostly) and others.\n\nThese are not valid comparisons. Different libraries with different usage and purposes. You instantiate Retrofit objects because it's one object per service, not one global object that's passed around. Moshi has a lot of stateful internals that make an instance unique, whereas RxJava only has a handful of these. They are also not used as ubiquitously as RxJava is. A more valid example would be something like `Timber`. Can you imagine if you had to inject that everywhere you wanted to use it? Simple classes, utility methods, etc all suddenly require DI or an extra parameter.\n\nI don't agree with those that would argue that anything and everything should be injected with DI and mockable, which this seems to be partially motivated by. Like everything else, the answer is \"it depends\". In RxJava's case, I think the flexibility to use it via static APIs is part of what makes it so appealing and powerful. The plugins and hooks are invisible to most users currently, and forcing this to a system where everything is an instance that must be passed around seems like major overkill.\n\nThis seems like an issue that largely revolves around the sticky 1.x plugins API, but you didn't talk at all about the improved rewrite of it that already exists in 2.x. I'd like to know what's wrong with that, rather than generalized \"plugins are stateful, therefor rx is stateful, therefore everything is dangerous\" vibe that the current argument seems to revolve around.\n\n---\n\nAs brief counter-examples:\n\n**If the goal is better testing support:** I wrote a nice test rule that lets you set schedulers on the fly for testing, and is quite clean. Simply add your rule, and call appropriate setters on it as needed in your tests. State is always cleared before and after to ensure clean and isolated states. Not all doom and gloom.\n\n**If the goal is to make state immutable and not dangerous:** It seems to me the crux of this argument is around preventing programmers from writing dangerous code. Someone could still accidentally set Schedulers.io() to use a main thread scheduler. There's only so much you can do to protect against people doing bad things. To restructure an entire framework just to make something that largely invisible to most users, has sensible default configurations, and obvious when misconfigured seems like a massive overreaction.\n\n---\n\nTo be clear, I'm not coming out 100% against this. I _do_ think there needs to be much better reasons to do this than what have been presented so far.\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

{"sentences":"Hello!  In the past couple of months I've put some time into developing a library for reactive/responsive programming based on a pull model called _choice streams_.  I believe that you might find it interesting.\n\nHere is a little bit of prose on the idea:\n\n  https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac/blob/master/Docs/Inverting.md\n\nI must apologise that the above document is somewhat out of date with respect to my improved understanding of Rx and contains a couple of incorrect assertions.\n\nAnd here is the current reference documentation on choice streams:\n\n  http://hopac.github.io/Hopac/Hopac.html#def:type%20Hopac.Stream.Stream\n\nSummary: It turns out that it is quite possible to do responsive and reactive programming with a pull model.  All you need is lightweight threads, lazy futures/promises and non-deterministic choice.  Even operators like `groupBy` and operations like `delay` (I call it `shift`) can be implemented for choice streams.  Many operations appear to be significantly simpler to implement on pull -based streams than on push -based streams.  The main feature lacking from choice streams is the subscription protocol, which means that operations like `Using` cannot be implemented with comparable semantics.\n\nPlease note that choice streams are still work-in-progress and, compared to Rx, there are a few combinators missing that I haven't yet had the time to implement, although I'm confident there will be no problems.  I'm already using choice streams in an actual application for reactive/responsive programming and they have worked without problems.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

Hence us pursuing either a solution that doesn't need to be pooled, or my pursuit of weak references so the release to the pool is automated. \n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

Current implementation of `BehaviorSubject.create(defaultValue)` sets default value to `volatile Object latest` field of `SubjectSubscriptionManager`.\n2. When you call `onNext()` it also sets new value to that `volatile` field without any synchronization. \n3. When you `subscribe()` it won't start with `defaultValue` that you've passed as initial but it will emit that `volatile latest` state instead -> that leads to the effect that @sregg sees.\n\nAnd now I'm not sure that `toSerialized()` will help with initial value because even though it synchronizes `onNext`, emission of the default value goes trough different lock object and still may happen concurrently with `onNext`…\n\n@sregg as temporary solution you can try to create `BehaviorSubject` **without** default value, convert it `toSerialized()` and set default value via `onNext` before giving reference to the subject to other threads, this should give you threading consistency you want to achieve.\n\nProbably we need to define this behavior better either in javadoc or even change current impementation to emit `default` initial value first and only then emit `volatile latest`.\n\n@akarnokd will be great to get your comment here!\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

After the directory is 'grepped', the entry is deleted from the hash table.\nAnd if we enter the directory and there's already a corresponding entry in the hash table, then probably there are symlinks that form a loop (or directory hierarchy may be corrupted). \n\nTherefore, it would be awesome to add the similar feature to `ag`. \n\nI'm ready to dive into the problem and propose a working solution.

I wrote a few of my own, but I don't want to influence yours. Please take a couple minutes to think of solutions before reading any farther.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nMy ideas:\n1. Locking every file. This seems inefficient. _Every_ file has to be locked while it's searched, and every file with a match has to be locked until the matches are printed out. This also might require write permissions on the files being searched, or cause searching to hang while waiting for a file lock. I'm pretty sure most filesystems and OSes require write permissions to exclusively lock a file.\n2. Adding a --no-mmap option. I'm not sure how useful this would be. I think most people who see a segfault would say, \"This program sucks.\" and stop using it.\n3. Default to reading files into buffers and add a --mmap option. This increases memory usage and hurts performance.\n\nThat's what I've thought of after a couple minutes. I'm split between option 2 and doing nothing. I welcome other ideas.\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"Your benchmark has several issues.\n1. Did you build the Android source or is this a clean checkout? A decent chunk of ag's speed often comes from ignoring giant binary files that people accidentally search with `grep`.\n2. Your search is returning tens of thousands of results, which is unrealistic for normal usage. Typically, people are looking for dozens of results at most. This is why ag's printing code isn't optimized at all. If there are a ton of results, printing is likely to be the bottleneck.\n3. Grep isn't printing out line numbers. Ag prints line numbers by default, which is an expensive operation. Still, line numbers are very useful when searching code.\n4. Grep's results can be interspersed, while ag's are segregated by file.\n5. It looks like you're only searching `.java` files. This obviates the need for most of ag's ignore features (and most of your `-prune` options to `find`). Ag is meant to be fast by default, even when you don't know what files you want to search. `ag android` takes zero mental effort and runs pretty quickly, considering the size of the directory.\n\nI realize it would take a long time fully address every one of these issues, so don't feel obliged to reply to every one.

Enjoy\n\n**Concept**\n\nThe page should be entertaining to watch, fed with real time data, and open the webmaster to dig more into the other reports that Piwik offer. \n\n**Background**\nThis feature is heavily requested by the community (http://feedback.phpmyvisites.net/feedbacks/2630-last-n-visitor-details-config-info-path-etc) and would be really providing a plus to Piwik feature set.\n\n**Data provided**\n- at top of screen, clear summary:\n  - Today you had: N visits, M pages today\n  - In the last 30 minutes you had: X visits, Y pages\n- list of the last N visitors with their information \n  - settings (os, browser, resolution, plugins) - icons only, details on icon hover \n  - referer (keyword, name, icon, clickable url - useful for SEO)\n  - country icon\n  - IP for piwik users with admin permission or super user\n  - count of pages seen during this visit\n  - time spent during this visit\n  - number of goals converted, click on goals would show the list of pages with goals highlighted (see below)\n- for each visit, it is possible to view pages: \n  - page title, \n  - page url that links to it, \n  - outlinks are shown different colors (icon ?)\n  - downloads are shown different colors (icon ?)\n  - when the page view was a Goal trigger, different color (icon ?) along with goal name and revenue.\n\n**UI features**\n- this page should make it possible to view all past visits for a current returning visitor. The idea would be to have an icon when the visitor is a returning visitor. Clicking on this icon would show the past visits for this visit. This is a UI challenge to make it look good and make it usable. for examples, previous visits rows could be shown below the visit row with a left margin and below a title \"This visitor previously visited the website:\". \n- by default, the spy mode would be enabled, therefore the page would reload regularly (every 2 seconds?) and show the new visits. We need a way to pause/resume the spy mode, if traffic is too big or if user wants to take more time to analyze existing traffic snapshot\n- all the data would be shown in a one page interface, to simplify browsing and discovery; this poses UI challenges to make the page usable and looking clean.\n- all data would be provided through the Live! plugin API. \n- there is an open question on how to refresh visits for which visitors view a new page. For example, we could highlight the visit row in yellow background and add the new page row below the visit. Or we could automatically move the visit with the new page view at the top of the page and highlight (eg. yellow background) the new page view.\n\n**in V2**\n- on the right of the spy, or on a different \"spy page\", we could show a auto-refreshing google map with the new visits in real time. see #5466\n\nAny feedback? Anybody would like to help implementing this  interesting new plugin and UI challenge? \n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

{"sentences":"This RFC is about discussing changes in the configuration system.\n\nCurrent status is a mix of:\n- INI files\n- Configuration values in code\n- Objects created in the code\n\nCurrently too many things are configured at runtime instead of in a configuration file. For example some things are configured through events. By separating configuration and execution, we end up with a more explicit config and simpler code (ridden of configuration). And we offer more extension points since plugins can override everything in the config (not that they always should ;) ).\n\nChanges proposed:\n- move config options from INI files to DI config\n- move configuration logic (that is in the code) to DI config\n- move objects creation to DI config (or factory objects called by DI config)\n- plugins can provide an optional config file (e.g. named `config/config.php`?)\n\nList of DI configuration files and their order of inclusion:\n- `config/main.php`\n- `plugins/.../config/config.php` (Plugins configs)\n- `config/environment.dev.php`\n- `config/environment.test.php`\n- `config/config.php` (User config)\n\nEnvironment config allows to override default config and to avoid doing so dynamically it in the code.\n#### Example\n\nWhen configured to log to file, the logger reads the file name from the `Config` object.\n\nThen it gets the `tmp` path and append the filename to it.\n\nThen it gets the Piwik Instance ID and appends it to the path (if not null), which is a special case for the `CloudAdmin` plugin.\n\nThis could be replaced by a config looking like this (this is an abstract config syntax for simplicity):\n- default config:\n  - `tmpPath = PIWIK_ROOT . '/tmp'`\n  - `logFile = tmpPath . '/logs/piwik.log'`\n\nThis covers the most common cases. Then if a plugin (e.g. CloudAdmin) wants to customize the path:\n- `CloudAdmin` config:\n  - `tmpPath = tmpPath . '/' . instanceId` (replace the default config value)\n- User config:\n  - `instanceId = 123`\n\nIn the end, we end up with the same result except configuration is separated from execution (the file is not configured in code). The config is more explicit, and also more extensible. No need to add custom \"instance ID\" code in Piwik Core just for a feature of the CloudAdmin plugin.\n#### Do we keep INI files?\n\n2 things:\n- global/internal Piwik config\n- user config\n\nGlobal config should be moved to DI config because it's much more powerful so I don't see the point to maintain 2 separated configs.\n\nHowever user config can be changed by users (obviously) so it might be best if it's as simple as possible (PHP syntax might be too much).\n\nI think DI config files is not incompatible with being simple. If we stick to INI, we'll seriously limit what users can do and override. With DI config they have much more power, yet we can still provide simple configuration options on a use case basis (i.e. no complex PHP syntax).\n\nQuick and **dirty** example with the logger:\n\n``` php\n// User config\nreturn [\n    'logger' => 'file' // or \"stdout\" or \"database\"\n];\n\n// Global config\nreturn [\n    'Psr\\Logger\\LoggerInterface' => DI\\factory(function ($container) {\n        $choice = $container->get('logger');\n\n        if ($choice === 'file') {\n            // ...\n        } else // ...\n    }),\n];\n```\n\nThen it still leaves the possibility to advanced users (e.g. Piwik Pro Cloud) to override `Psr\\Logger\\LoggerInterface` in their user config to something completely different.\n\nBy the way this is how Symfony works with Bundle: you can set up objects manually (e.g. set up your logger and all) or use a bundle that will abstract and simplify the config for you so that you just have to set 1 or 2 options.\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"A lot of links are still on http. Many of them get 301-redirected to https. Which is good: The 301-redirect should remain, to not break existing links somewhere in the wild.\n\nBut on web pages hosted by piwik, piwik should migrate the links to https, so that users get to the https version without being 301-redirected.\n\nReason:\n\n- **Security:** 301-redirects are requests which are requested and responded via http. Which is unencrypted, and more important, not safe against manipulation and  not authenticating the server. E.g. MITM can manipulate the target URL to something phishy.\n\n- **Performance:** Reducing the number of 301-redirects which are actually _executed_ every day improves the performance of a web page (saves a round trip for each and every 301 redirect). Performance is not the main point for me, just nice to have.\n\nNow that piwik already 301-redirects most of its http links to https, a link checker can be taken to analyze all these 301-redirects and fix them to https where possible. That should work for all links to https-only web sites (including external links like e.g. links to twitter).\n\nFirst impression: https://validator.w3.org/checklink?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpiwik.org&hide_type=all&recursive=on&depth=5&check=Check\n\nThis issue is a follow-up to #8236","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

Imagine we add a `plugins/VisitorInterest/Widgets.php` file to Piwik in 2.6.0 and a user updates from 2.4.0 to 2.6.0.\n\nWhat will happen is that `plugins/VisitorInterest/Widgets.php` will be copied to the users Piwik installation but afterwards removed by an update in 2.5.0 although the file should not be removed. So this solution does not really work either. Maybe we could check the age of the file that is supposed to be deleted and then decide whether to delete or not but even this might not work in all cases (eg if Update executed later etc)\n\nThe only solution that seems to work for me is by comparing the new Piwik version with the current Piwik version of the user and remove no longer needed files as explained and implemented above. But users will have to update at least twice until it works (see above). \n\nI just tested an update from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0-b2 and those Widget files above still exist but it is not that much of a problem as same widgets that are added multiple times are only shown once.

{"sentences":"> by how much using Piwk affects the performance of a website\n\nThere is no such single answer. It depends on many things. Like how you embed Piwik, how fast your server is, where your audience is located, whether you server the piwik.js eg via CDN, whether you have proper caching in place for piwik.js and gzip, whether you load it from same domain or different one, how \"big\" your website is in terms of files that need to be loaded and size etc. Also it depends on how you define \"performance\". Do you mean page load time? page ready time? Do you mean fps when scrolling or doing something on the website etc.\n\nIn general there should be once a request to piwik.js and then it should be cached. It is only a few kb and should be fast yet still user needs to load it. If performance is super important, I'd recommend to have a look and embed it eg like this after page load (with the risk of missing some visitors to be tracked): https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues/9077 \n\nThen there is usually one request eg. per pageview which is like only a few bytes and depending on your server can take anything between 4ms and like 500ms. This is in the background though and user shouldn't notice it. Also doesn't use much on the network as said only few bytes.\n\nIf you use premium features like Media Analytics or Form Analytics there might be more requests while a user watches a video or uses a form but they all have small footprints.\n\nAnother thing that may affect performance is when clicking on an outlink (to different website) and Piwik tracks it, then we may delay the opening on the other website by like 300ms or 500ms to make sure the tracking request to measure the outlink is sent.\n\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"> Loading data... could be instead \"Loading Evolution data for {here icon and label name}\" this could be done by copying the HTML of Label row, including the icons/logos? \n\nThe problem is that we only have the label in the URL parameter. Since RE launched by changing the hash part of the URL, we don't have the data table row DOM el. What we have is the label - we could show that but it looks weird for subtables. E.g. when row evolution is openend on an outlink, it might look like \"www.example.com > /\".\nWe don't have the icon at all so there's no way to show it expept add it to the URL too which introduces XSS possibilities. We could only show it when RE has been launched from a table and pass the row dom el around but this would add complexity to the already complex code.\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do about this request.

{"sentences":"Well I have had recent visits from google.com.hk and google.com.ph which both used /imglanding after the domain. But they both had \"q=\" and \"prev\" containing the search phrase. So ommitting a check for imglanding puts the keywords in a non google images count which is suspect.\nWhen trying to reproduce it I get imgres but I'm using a UK IP so results may be different.\n\nBut importantly, anyone thinking they can change google searchengine name, without understanding how the code in common.php works, will find it just doesn't work because of the way its coded currently. Most users, I suspect, will just think they can change the search engines to whatever they like but the enforced default to \"Google Images\" is likely to be a mystery to them. I see no need to enforce that. If users then choose to change searchengine names they can.\n\nI have now changed my code and it seems to be working. It works on the principle that if the domain contains google, then it checks for /imgres and if found it does its stuff. But also within the original google check, checks for \"images\" in search engine name and if not found adds it to end of search engine name. \nSo this works for both the current standard setup but also works for anyone changing their search engine names for google (I think).\n\noriginal code in common.php:\n\n```\n\n        if($searchEngineName == 'Google Images'\n            || ($searchEngineName == 'Google' && strpos($refererUrl, '/imgres') !== false) )\n        {\n            $query = urldecode(trim(strtolower(self::getParameterFromQueryString($query, 'prev'))));\n            $query = str_replace('&', '&amp;', strstr($query, '?'));\n            $searchEngineName = 'Google Images';\n        }\n```\n\nmy new code:\n\n```\n  if ( strpos(strtolower($searchEngineName), 'google') !== false && strpos($refererUrl, '/imgres') !== false ) \n        {\n            $query = urldecode(trim(strtolower(self::getParameterFromQueryString($query, 'prev'))));\n            $query = str_replace('&', '&amp;', strstr($query, '?'));\n            if ( strpos(strtolower($searchEngineName), 'images') === false )\n   {\n             $searchEngineName = $searchEngineName . ' Images';\n            }   \n        }\n```\n\nI have also changed my search engine names but that is another matter.\n\np.s. you now have my email address.\n\nI just thought it would provide flexibility for those wanting to change their google searchengine names to split by country. The default names can remain as now but users don't have to worry about code not working if they do decide to change them. \n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"Hee guys, (sorry for typos english isn't my native language)\n\nI know its not the time to really get into this part of production yet, but since i cannot contribute to the current stage (I dont have any experience in programing) and really want to participate because I really like what you guys are doing. I came up with the following:\n\nAwards:\nIn RCT2 you could win awards for being the best in this or that. Though its a cool feature it didn't really gave you anything. Let's say you win the award for safest park in the country. Would it be cool to earn a discount on new mechanics or earn a free month of wages. At least something that will benefit you. For every award you get you can think of something nice to give. This could add a lot of fun to the game.\n\nFanatic groups of peeps:\nIn real life there are people that travel around the world in groups to find the most badass rollercoasters to ride in them. Now I thought that mayby it would be cool if you constructed a rollercoaster with a excitement rating over a 9 or so that a group of people would enter your park (all dressed the same!) and go straight for your badass rollercoaster. You can implement this same principle for all sorts of attractions. like go karts or ride in a car. \n\nMountain tool:\nIn one of the rtc1 additions there where some mountain tool options that where not included in rct2 because rct2 had the options of building scenery. But if I remember it correctly you could give the side of a hill the colour yellow and red and these also changed the apperance of an attraction going in the side of a mountian. They where round instead of square. Could you guys bring this back?\n\nEye dropper:\nFor example: you brought down a piece of land, now scenery on top of it gets deleted. (This has to disapear btw) it is very annoying to search for one or two scenery objects to replace it. An eye drop option would make this much, much easier and would speed up a building process in general.\n\nHandyman:\nHandymans could use some updates as well. How they orientate their selves around paths and towards litter. Besides that they should be able to fix vandelism. I know you guys already have some cheats to help this, but i mean actually seeing a handyman fix a bench. I can also remember a feature that chis saywer had in the original plans for rtc. And that was a handyman taking a lunch break. There's a change there might be something left in de game that shows this. How cool would it be to add this.\n\nTour guide:\nAn additional employee that walks around and accumulates peeps that will bring a buch of people from one place to another and in the mean time stops and pretends it is giving some information. This will bring the happiness up. This could also be implemented as an attraction maybe.\n\nMobile salesman.\nAn additional employee that walks around and sells for example balloons, souvenirs or icecream.\n\nMedic:\nAn additional employee. There are benches and emergency posts for peeps to go to. To lower there nausia. But they will only do so when there nausia has reached a certain point. These workers will reduce lets say 20-25% percent of nausia when he/she is helping a peep. They help peeps that have a nausia rating higher than 10%.\n\nOriginal peep codes:\nSome cheat codes that where put in the game made some of the guests do some unique stuff. Like taking photographs and making paintings. There might be some cool ways to implement these features in the game without having them to activate threw cheat codes. The michael schumacher cheat code that let a person to drive really fast would be al cool option to use for a fanatic group of peeps when you have build a go karts attraction that has a high excitement rating. \n\nThe amazing earl:\nThis guy had made alot of mods for rollercoaster tycoon 2. All of his creations look like they where made by chris saywer. The blend in perfectly. These could be used to expand the options of attractions. Here's a link: http://rct.wikia.com/wiki/The_Amazing_Earl \n\nPeeps:\nI would like to see that peeps would enjoy the scenery more than they did originaly. By not alone giving them a bigger variety in thoughts about this. But also incorporate a game mechanic that lets a peep be picky in wich attraction he wants to go in based on the scenery that ride has to offer. There are no graphics for girls or for other races in the game. I dont know if you guys are planning to improve rtc up to that extant. but it would be awesome! If some of the peeps would prefer to walk in groups or lets say with there family that would be cool. A bigger variety in appearance. Like peeps having backpacks, already whearing glasses or applauding when there's a new ride available (only peeps that are close to the new ride)\n\nRandom events:\nPlanes flying over, personal messages from peeps that you follow, having peeps ask for the completion of a particular ride. fulfilling this need will boost some stats, accidents that can happen during rides that lowers happines, peeps finding money, peeps finding items raises their happines, peeps finding their solmates and stay together. 20% higher chance of this happening on the swans ride ( oehw,, romantic)\npeeps sharing money or giving stuff, peeps saying funny stuff like: I think I left my oven on, at home. peeps that steal stuff which a guard can prevent, more wild life (fish, birds), peeps that request you to plant them somewhere else. A peep on drugs haha doing crazy stuff.\nAnd many more you name it.

{"sentences":"Raising a mountain with a one-tile-square selection costs $80.  Considering that nine tiles are affected, one might think the cost should be closer to $20*9 = $180, but Chris Sawyer's landscaping service offers a discount.  (If I recall correctly, this is consistent with RCT1.)\n\n![1 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714404/eb701bc6-7aab-11e5-8cfc-b64ff1b094cd.png)\n\nWith OpenRCT2, we can build mountains that have larger plateaus.  A mountain with a top two tiles square costs $320 to form.  Seeing as 16 tiles are affected, $20 \\* 16 = $320 sounds like it's about the right price to pay.\n\n![2 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714414/249c9668-7aac-11e5-853d-addf639926f5.png)\n\nBy the time we reach a 3x3 mountain, the cost is $720.  25 tiles are affected, so we'd expect to pay closer to $20*25 = $500.  That said, some of the tiles would have taken two $20 operations to form, so it's about right regardless.\n\n![3 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714438/973d9848-7aac-11e5-977b-17b236ec456c.png)\n\nA 4x4 mountain costs $1,280 to start, which is well above the $20 \\* 36 = $720 we might expect to pay for it.  This is the turning point:  we could have built the same shape for less money using the standard tools.\n\n![4 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714441/bb0d9d04-7aac-11e5-8274-bff002bb9171.png)\n\nIt doesn't get better from here.  Starting a 64x64 mountain costs $327,680, which is way above the estimated $87,120.\n\nIt seems that the mountain tool is very naive in its pricing:  it simply multiplies the one-tile price by the number of tiles in the selection.  This isn't really the best way to go about it because it overcounts redundant land-moving operations.  I propose we change the pricing scheme to evaluate how much money it would cost if tiles were moved manually and use that value instead of the naive multiplication.\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

This gives a lot of problems, unsolvable without redoing entire park sections, when peeps are getting stuck in a corner somewhere because their AI changed from when the area was originally built. In general, this AI mechanic limits park composition a lot. I hope you can solve this soon, because it's the only thing in OpenRCT that ruins my fun occassionally.

{"sentences":"**OS:** Linux\n\nThe compiled binary for Linux x86-64 of OpenRCT2 takes a lot of space, ~40MiB unpacked for just the ELF binary. This is partially because we use `RelWithDebInfo` build type, which embeds debug symbols into the file itself. This is very useful when we need to do actual debugging, but in most cases it just takes space.\n\nThe DWARF debug information, among others, has two types of informations:\n* code-to-source-line mappings\n* variable tracking information\n\nFor user to be able to provide valuable stack traces (symbolicated, with line numbers), only the first part is needed\\* and the variable tracking can be turned off with `-fno-var-tracking` GCC option and this results in 25% smaller binary (30MiB). Unfortunately, disabling it at compilation time makes debug symbols much less useful.\n\nInstead, I would like to try removing it in a post-process step. It looks like variable tracking information is located in `.debug_loc` section and perhaps simply extracting it out from the binary and into separate symbol file would yield desired effect:\n* having smaller distributed binaries\n* not sacrificing value of debug information.\n\n\\* This is just my assumption for now, I still have to verify it.","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"It has been suggested once before. It's not what I would call much-requested.\n\nAnyway, there is a very good reason for it, which you already mentioned actually: most parks are closed in the winter months, as most roller coasters cannot operate properly when it's too cold, and maintenance work is carried out during those months. Of course, there are some exceptions, even in temperate climates like in The Netherlands.\n\nHowever, it would complicate things beyond belief. An RCT year (8 months) takes about 90 minutes. It would either mean most of your rides will be closed for 45 minutes, or open and close every few minutes (a day takes about 20-40 seconds in RCT!) to take the weather in account. Of course, in areas where it's always warm enough, that wouldn't apply, but then it would mean that you end up with a seriously complicated game, with very inconsistent behaviour between climates.\n\nIn short, I am against this. It's far too complicating and doesn't improve gameplay - in fact, I would say it degrades gameplay for the reasons I mentioned above.\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

{"sentences":"## Goals\n\nThe current Realm API seemed to be focused on accessing persisted object \"on-the-fly\" from anywhere in the app. While this can be beneficial and simple to use, a more complex, layered architecture cannot be achieved with this.\nI'm talking about an architecture where database access is limited to a separate **Data** layer so effectivelyI would only use Realm there. I'm trying to implement this architecture using RxSwift, where I would like to pass business entities (which are Realm objects) via Observables to the **Domain** layer, where my business logic is implemented using RxSwift operators and finally, the result will arrive to the **Presentation** layer which includes ViewControllers and Views. The core of this is that everything before the Presentation layer have to be done in a separate thread asynchronously which could be achieved easily with RxSwift. Realm objects however cannot be passed between threads, so it makes this approach impossible. However, in Java, Realm already has a solution which would be nice in Swift.

{"sentences":"I've been evaluating Realm and its performance.  An important use case of mine involves large numbers (100000+) of \"micro objects\".  These are really small objects with no more than a few fields, most of which are numbers (for this test no more than 64 bytes of data total).  Query performance is very good, even with high object counts, but adding, deleting, and modifying large numbers of objects from Realm can be very slow.\n\n**Test setting:**\n- Realm version:  0.83.\n- Hardware / OS:  2.3Ghz Retina MacBook Pro / OS X 10.9.4.\n- No properties are indexed or have any attributes (confirmed with attributesForProperty:).\n- Using the defaultRealm.\n- Setting `[RLMRealm useInMemoryDefaultRealm]` has no effect (not that I could run this way for production).\n- Setting `defaultRealm.autorefresh = NO` has no effect (and it always seems to be turned on again during subsequent uses of the realm).\n\n**Add objects test:**\nI am generating n RLMObjects, adding them to an NSArray, then timing adding that array to the realm with `[realm transactionWithBlock:^{  [realm addObjectsFromArray:array];  }];`\n- Adding a 100000 object array:  10.891676 seconds!\n- Adding a 50000 object array:  2.418253 seconds!\n- Adding a 25000 object array:  0.660159 seconds.\n- Adding a 10000 object array:  0.131164 seconds.\n\nIt does not seem to matter how many objects are in the realm prior to adding the objects.  Adding a 10000 object array takes the same time if 0 objects are in the Realm or 1 million objects are in the Realm.\n\n**Remove objects test:**\nI am taking n RLMObjects that exist in the Realm, adding them to an NSArray, then timing removing that array from the realm with `[realm transactionWithBlock:^{  [realm deleteObjects:itemsToRemove];  }];`\n- Removing a 100000 object array:  10.855915 seconds!\n- Removing a 50000 object array:  2.325231 seconds!\n- Removing a 25000 object array:  0.597455 seconds.\n- Removing a 10000 object array:  0.102262 seconds.\n\nIt's basically the same performance as the add case.  Like the add case, the number of objects that exist in the Realm do not seem to impact delete performance.\n\n**Modify objects test:**\nI am taking the first n RLMObjects from a 100000 object Realm and changing a single integer property similar to above.\n- Modifying 100000 objects:  9 _minutes_ 8.5386 seconds! (!!)\n- Modifying 50000 objects:  4 _minutes_ 36.5388 seconds! (!!)\n- Modifying 25000 objects:  2 _minutes_ 18.1554 seconds! (!!)\n- Modifying 10000 objects:  55.511092 seconds! (!!)\n- Modifying 5000 objects:  27.538283 seconds! (!)\n- Modifying 1000 objects:  5.507278 seconds!\n- Modifying 500 objects:  2.797262 seconds!\n- Modifying 100 objects:  0.545877 seconds!\n\nTaking the first n RLMObjects from a 10000 object Realm and changing a single integer property similar to above.\n- Modifying 10000 objects:  5.118958 seconds!\n- Modifying 5000 objects:  2.646211 seconds!\n- Modifying 1000 objects:  0.525338 seconds!\n- Modifying 500 objects:  0.270613 seconds!\n- Modifying 100 objects:  0.056823 seconds.\n\nThe number of objects in the Realm do impact performance here.  From these results, when you have 10x the objects in the Realm, the result is about 10x slower performance for the same number of objects modified in a single transaction!\n\n**Takeaways:**\n- When adding and removing items from a Realm, generally, using more transactions with fewer objects performs significantly faster than using fewer transitions with more objects.  i.e., Add 10 batches of 10K objects instead of 1 batch of 100K objects.  I have not approximated the point of diminishing returns with this.  This shouldn't be.  When adding an array of objects, Realm knows the total number of items it is getting and has a schema for all of them.  It should be able to make decent estimates for the amount of memory it needs to allocate (and with some objects, perfect estimates) and the space it needs to free.\n- Modifying is show-stopper expensive, even in a \"very small\" (for my case) 10K object Realm with fewer objects being modified.  While I have not tried this, from the data above it seems like it would be faster to query Realm for the objects in question, delete them, recreate new instances with the correct properties, and add them, combining it with the multi-batch approach mentioned above.  This should not be the case.  That's more work (and more needless notifications generated).\n- Deleting objects taking as long as adding objects - I don't know what to think.  It is not vacuuming the Realm file.\n\n**Other notes:**\n- Memory use remained acceptable throughout the testing.\n\nI generally like Realm's API and how to thinks about things even with what it has missing.  I'd like to use it, but it doesn't seem particularly suited for this use case.  Thoughts about what can be done here or what the timeline is for improvements?\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

I come from the realm-java lib where creating unmanaged instances of managed instances is built into the lib. What is the realm-cocoa equivalent or best practice instead? \n\nMy use case: I perform a realm query to get a realm `Object` > I perform a write on this object > Perform an API call > Perform another write on this object. \n\nI am trying to create an unmanaged object because I can share the object across threads (as I will be on a different thread after the API call is performed since the API call will be performed on another thread and the callback after it is complete will be called from this API thread).\n\nI was looking through the Realm docs yesterday for Swift and it mentioned [passing instances across threads](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#passing-instances-across-threads). I am guessing this is the realm-cocoa equivalent to working with managed objects across threads? \n\nI don't mind this solution. However, it does not seem as flexible as creating an unmanaged object. Unmanaged objects are very flexible do handle them however you would like.

How were you testing the migration?\n\n---\n\nComing to the problem you're seeing with the deployed version: Did you added `dateSaved` as a property and users could be stuck on an older version which don't have that property yet in their schemas? Because in such a case you would get that error on an attempt to access a non-existing property.\n\nSo if you still know or can figure out with which version, you introduced that property, then you can just make sure that this migration enumerations only objects of schemas which have this property already.\n\n``` swift\nif (5...13).contains(oldSchemaVersion) {\n  migration.enumerate(Post.className()) { oldObject, newObject in\n    if let oldDateSaved = oldObject?[\"dateSaved\"] as? NSDate {\n       newObject?[\"dateSaved\"] = oldDateSaved.timeIntervalSince1970 > 0 ? oldDateSaved : nil\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can dynamically check the `oldObject.objectSchema` to figure out whether that property already exists. This could look then like below:\n\n``` swift\nif oldSchemaVersion < 13 {\n  migration.enumerate(Post.className()) { oldObject, newObject in\n    guard let _ = oldObject?.objectSchema[\"dateSaved\"] else {\n       newObject?[\"dateSaved\"] = nil\n       return\n    }\n    if let oldDateSaved = oldObject?[\"dateSaved\"] as?

Such notifications will run within the context of the current write transaction, meaning attempting to begin a write transaction within the notification handler will cause Realm to throw an exception.\n\nI understand that it is expected behavior, but is it also wanted behavior?

{"sentences":"To avoid having data change beneath your feet in the middle of a function, we only update which version of the data an RLMRealm uses between each iteration of the runloop. Unfortunately, because GCD blocks are the highest-priority events, `dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ ... })` immediately after a commit can result in the block being run on the main thread before our autorefresh signal, resulting in the block seeing the version of the Realm from before the commit.\n\nYou can work around this by explicitly calling `[realm refresh]` at the beginning of your block that needs to see the latest data.

When you commit a write transaction on a background thread, a notification is then sent to other Realm instances on other threads (this works through a named pipe) to refresh to the latest version of the DB that includes the recently committed transaction. The problem though is that notification is processed on the receiving thread only during the default run loop mode.

Using a Book's PK as an OptionalString's PK at the same time as using the Author's PK as an OptionalString's PK will work only while there are no duplicate PKs in the Author and Book tables (which can't be guaranteed).\nAlso, if the Author has multiple properties that are OptionalStrings there's a PK clash again (that's not a 1-to-1 relationship, strictly speaking).\n\nProbably to do this right each OptionalString property should be of some different class, like AuthorName or BookName, which both descend from OptionalString. But that means creating new classes not because they're logically needed, but because of implementation intricacies.

Of course, the `deploy:check` report bares no surprises: the `vagrant` user cannot write in the directories created during `deploy:setup` since the two users belong to different groups – `root:root` versus `vagrant:vagrant`\n\n_Note:_ For output listing, and other details, please check [the sister-question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/15144815/341929).\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind this, and what prerequisite is not satisfied yet so the deployment passes this issue?  \nIs there any elegant way to make this work, or is SSH-ing in and changing the permissions manually the way to go?\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"I think I did also write the code for `assets_manifest.yml`, and that was solely to handle rollbacks. When you only store the `asset_manifest.yml` files in the release directories, they get deleted whenever the release is cleaned up. This is a problem, because it's very possible to cycle through all your releases (e.g. 5) well before your assets expiry time, such as the default of 2 weeks. So as soon as you clean up the release, all of the unique assets in that file are going to be deleted. My ideal solution was to keep timestamped asset manifests in a separate shared directory, where their timestamp is set to the _last_ time they were deployed. That means that the manifest file generated during the previous deploy would have the same timestamp as the current release, because that was the last time that those assets were being served to web browsers. If all of this is in place, then we can just delete any manifests with a timestamp older than 2 weeks (for example), and your assets will always be expired correctly, no matter how many releases you keep, how many times you deploy, or how frequently you deploy.\n\nSo those are the edge cases that aren't handled by the backed up manifest solution. They are handled by the mtime solution, but that turned out to be terribly slow. \n\nGreat work on the Rails 4 assets support, btw!\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

{"sentences":"> ... I don't see the use-case myself, ...\n\nWhen I created this feature request our deployment strategy was different than it currently is.\n\nBy that time we used to use a single role for everything and we wanted to specify the hooks ourselves depending on which environment and application to load but simply requiring the gems in Capfile would activate all hooks.\n\nCurrently we no longer set up the roles in config/deploy.rb but we conditionally set up the roles depending on the environment and application so that it doesn't matter if the hook was installed since we stopped using `on(:all)` blocks.\n\nThe gems we use (bundler, rails, sidekiq) don't use `on(:all)` blocks with automatic hooks, so we're fine with the current Capistrano state currently. I can still think that this feature might be used for some gem possibly, but I'd prefer to have a real use-case scenario well defined before implementing such feature in a patch to avoid bloating Capistrano's source code.\n\nI'll close this ticket for now and if I find myself needing it again I'll reopen the issue and implement some patch if you agree with the approach.\n\nWe currently use a mix of Capistrano and Chef to deploy to our environments. It was similar to this a while ago, but it went through some changes after I created this repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/rosenfeld/capistrano-chef-deployment\n\nThis was created for an article I've written about the approach:\n\nhttps://www.packtpub.com/books/content/part-1-managing-multiple-apps-and-environments-capistrano-3-and-chef-solo (part 2 hasn't been published yet I guess - formatting and code highlighting is not enabled in this article, but this is out of my control)\n\nPreviously we had been using Capistrano more like this:\n\nhttps://www.packtpub.com/books/content/part-1-managing-multiple-apps-and-environments-capistrano-3-and-chef-solo\nhttps://www.packtpub.com/books/content/part-2-deploying-multiple-applications-capistrano-single-project\n\nCurrently our deployment strategy consists of a single \"app\" Capistrano environment and we use something like spec=server_environment_app to decide what to do in the Capistrano side. Capistrano will then run Chef possibly in multiple servers (the database server, the proxy server and every server involved in the process) before running the application's Capistrano recipes (in the deploy:full task).\n\nWe don't currently need to patch Capistrano in any way to achieve that goal.

The formatters don't always receive plain strings, they receive `Command` objects, and whatever else, and they make decisions about how to print them, you might take a look at https://github.com/mattbrictson/airbrussh for some inspiration, although you wouldn't have to go anywhere near that far, simply keep a copy of each thing that is written to your output, and then do something with it to render it for the user.

{"sentences":"Actually, apart from this one issue which I'm happy enough to continue working around, it works fine here. Perhaps the fact that we've already moved to a system backed by ACLs, where we can deploy as ourselves rather than the shared user running Rails, has made this work better than it might have otherwise.\n\nWe were deploying remotely but have just switched to `:local` because our new environment is very locked down and we only allow SSH access from one specific access machine. We could deploy from there but it made more sense to pull our Capistrano files onto the target, which already has Ruby installed and already has access to the git server. The initial setup is done by Chef so all we have to do is jump on there and basically run `bundle install; cap deploy`.\n\nI didn't consider Rake or Thor because Capistrano, whether local or remote, does exactly what we need it to do out of the box. This is a Rails application so it handles the assets and migrations, but even for our non-Rails stuff, it intelligently deploys each release whilst dealing with RVM and Bundler. I don't want to give that up! It's true that we are not using the multi-server aspect of it, beyond having multiple stages, but that's only a small part of the larger package.\n\nI'm not aware of the reasons why you want to remove `:local` but if I come across any issues, I'll do my best to fix them myself.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

{"sentences":"Sure, I'd love to answer any questions.\n1. From the docs: Assets are shared across deploys to avoid mid-deploy mismatches between old application html asking for assets and getting a 404 file not found error. This is because deploying a new release does not guarantee that the previous assets won't be requested any more. (Maybe a browser has some cached html which references the old asset.)\n2. This is what I've just been working on. Assets are currently fully recompiled on each run, and I've just finished the feature to only recompile changed assets based on their source fingerprints. See https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3 and https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/pull/21. This is the main reason I've been fixing up assets for Capistrano.\n3. Because my pull requests have not yet been merged :)\n4. Yes, which is what I'm solving in #281 \n5. #281 does not address #227 (skip if no changes to assets), it only addresses #210 (rollback of cap deploy:assets uses newest assets). However, it also adds a feature to clean up unneeded assets so your `shared/assets` directory doesn't keep growing out of control. I've addressed #227 with pull requests to `sprockets-rails` and `sprockets` (solving the problem at the source), as well as reasing my [turbo-sprockets-rails3](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3) gem.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

So this solution would actually conflict with this use case.\n\nA better solution would check wether a block is passed to `run`, if this isn't the case it would close the standard input stream.\n\nClosing the standard input stream may be useful even if a block is passed to `run`.  So an explicit option to change the default behaviour would account for this use case, and `run` could `||=` this option based on whether a block is passed to the method.  This would make it easier to implement, a solution because `run` just uses `run_tree`, which wouldn't know whether a block is passed to `run`, so an options would propagate this knowledge.\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

You might have more success with multi-process, but you'll have to throw Sidekiq and your Actor pattern out.\n\nI'm not even certain if the underlying Net::SSH implementation is thread safe. There is WIP on a replacement release of Capistrano with a significantly different architecture, and more flexibility, I can't give you a timeline but \"summer 2012\" seems like a reasonable ballpark.\n\nAs a workaround, I'd recommend looking for the Sidekiq equivalent of Resque::Lock, or perhaps even better - have your actors fork the deploy task.\n\nJust some food for thought, short version - bide your time, the changes required would probably be a disaster (DSL and config, and task execution would need to change, and testing for thread safety is a nightmare, so we'd be looking at a LOT of work), the new implementation has a Queue/Actor pattern at the heart of it's design, so is much more likely to be right by default. \n\n## \n\nLee Hambley\n\nOn Friday, April 20, 2012 at 11:48 PM, James Miller wrote:\n\n> We're using cap to deploy multiple apps to multiple clusters simultaneously directly from Ruby using Sidekiq (multithreaded) for our message processor:\n> \n> ``` ruby\n> \n> def capistrano_config(options = {})\n> config = Capistrano::Configuration.new\n> config.load do\n> \n> # Configure basic app info\n> set :application, app.friendly_id\n> set :deploy_to, app.deploy_to_path\n> set :deploy_user, app.cluster.machine_username\n> set :ruby_version, app.ruby\n> set :current_path, app.current_path\n> set :shared_path, app.shared_path\n> set :user, app.cluster.machine_username\n> \n> namespace :deploy do\n> task :default do\n> # Do stuff...\n> end\n> end\n> end\n> return config\n> end\n> \n> capistrano_config(options).find_and_execute_task(\"deploy\")\n> ```\n> \n> This works very well, but if multiple deploys are run from sidekiq to different apps, the values defined with `set` in the config bleed into other `Capistrano::Configuration` instances.\n> \n> Do you have any ideas on potential workarounds for this?

My guess is that this is the revision from which the remaining files are checked out.\n\nI tracked this down to `build/release.sh` which is supposed to create the releases. Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure how to use this script works. It expects me to provide it a bundle (`git bundle`? Which I tried BTW) which I'm not sure how to create/generate. Some help on how to use this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for your excellent work on crouton :)\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

{"sentences":"Some time ago when the Pixel 2015 was released an issue was logged noting numerous performance issues in 14.04 including but not limited to graphical glitches on the mouse cursor when swapping between Chrome OS and Ubuntu, and a variety of other problems. I personally experienced poor performance, constant crashes in XFCE, games with sound errors and poor performance not present in 13.04 and 14.04 on 2995U-powered Chromebooks, hanging and crashing when logged out/rebooting/powering off via Ubuntu, and more.\n\nIn that issue (see link below) a solution was posted referencing the updating of the Intel graphics drivers. The good news is that for the Intel HD5500 and up (Broadwell i3, i5 and i7) this solves the issues. In fact on my Pixel after using this, Unity 14.04 is ridiculously great and everything I've tried has worked incredibly well.\n\nSadly, it looks like this driver update does NOT update the 3205U \"Intel HD Graphics\" for the Broadwell Celeron. These systems are still not working well at all in Crouton. \n\nThose of us who are mere mortals over on Reddit have not been able to figure out a solution to this and I found it odd that it didn't seem to be covered here, thus I figured I'd post it in the event that a) this wasn't a known problem, or b) it was a known problem with a solution (fingers crossed).\n\nReferenced issue, which is open but not quite in reference to what I've described, above:\nhttps://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/1519\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

{"sentences":"Once #234 merges, `crouton -u -n $chroot` should be very safe; it will update all targets, maintaining the release and mirror setting.  This means we could conceivably update crouton in an automated fashion.\n\nA few questions I'd like to open up:\n1. Is this a good idea?  Chromium OS does auto-updates very well, but it was designed from the ground-up to support it.  Updates downloaded but only applied atomically upon reboot.  The Linux userspace, on the other hand was never really designed for auto-updates.  Things aren't updated atomically, although open file semantics tend to keep running software working fine.  crouton itself should be fine with auto-updates, as flag semantics don't change.  People may not like the idea of their Linux install auto-updating, others may never update crouton or their chroot unless we do so for them.  Some sort of auto-updating may be necessary for the cras (#343) target, as updates to Chromium OS do not guarantee protocol compatibility for cras.  Perhaps auto-updates could be optionally disabled via a file in /etc/crouton\n2. Should auto-updates happen in the background?  If we do it in the background, updates to things like xephyr and touch will not apply until the next time crouton is started.  cras (#343) updates should apply for all newly-opened audio applications.  This isn't that far off of Chromium OS's behavior (requiring reboot), and we may be able to use zenity or the like to make a \"restart crouton\" icon once the update is complete.  Doing updates in the foreground would introduce an annoying delay when launching crouton, but you'd immediately get the updates.\n3. When should auto-update be triggered?  Checking each time enter-chroot is called is excessive.  We could limit it to once a week, or only auto-update when we detect that Chromium OS has auto-updated (via differences in /etc/lsb-release), which would have the benefit of updating more frequently for dev users.  Updates require a sizable chunk of data (crouton is small, but it triggers an upgrade of the underlying package manager as well), so should it avoid updating over mobile connections?\n4. Feedback.  How to provide feedback to the user that crouton is checking for updates, updating, and done updating?  zenity systray icons for desktop environments works, but what about for cli-only users?\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}
{"sentences":"If you use the -e flag when setting up crouton, when it prompts you to set up the root password, if you fail to give the same password twice or Ctrl-C out of the process before it succeeds, it never asks again.  Restarting \"crouton -e\" doesn't ask you for this again, even though it didn't succeed in setting it the last time it tried.\n\nI tried running \"passwd\" and \"sudo passwd\" to try and set up a password manually, but I keep getting errors about the password DB being locked.  Obviously the crouton scripts are doing something else, but it's not clear to me what.\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

Under ChromeOS having this layout works the following way: If I want the letter `ü` I type `Shift + '` followed by `u`. By replacing u with a or o I get ä or ö. Yet the letter ß works differently, I have to type `ralt + s`. So far so good.\n\nBefore using xiwi I remember it working just the same way under my chroot. Yet now, probably due to it being windowed, the behaviour has changed: in order to get ä, ö or ü I have to press `Shift + '` twice in order for it to work, which isn't too much of an inconvenience. But trying to get the letter ß has proven to be impossible. When I try the default command all I get is `s`. \n\nAny ideas?\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

As far as I can tell, the main remaining, perplexing issue is that gconf seems to be behaving differently when indirectly launched via a DM (be it lightdm or gdm) than it does when launched via xinit, which transitively makes gnome-session behave strangely.  gconf is not properly pulling in the systemwide default values for items.  Here's what I think the next things to try would be:\n1. Grab the crouton-desktops build from #61.  Be aware that the crouton used in there is quite old, so when you use it, specify a different prefix (i.e. `-p /usr/local/desktops` or something).\n2. Install the ubuntu target to a chroot: `sudo sh -e crouton-desktop -p /usr/local/desktops -t ubuntu`.\n3. Use `sudo sh -e /usr/local/desktops/startdm` to start lightdm, and log into a unity session.\n4. Use ps and /proc/pid/environ and whatnot to check the gnome-session and gconfd (is that right?) processes, in particular launch command line and environment variables.\n5. Do the exact same thing but using the latest crouton creating a unity chroot and launching with startunity.  There won't be a gnome-session process, but there will be a gconfd process (I think).\n6.

{"sentences":"Hm. So, in the last failure I posted, https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2688#issuecomment-250607576, I received this error:\n\n```\nE: Method http has died unexpectedly!\nE: Sub-process http received signal 4.\n```\n\ninstead of the usual\n\n```\nE: Method http has died unexpectedly!\nE: Sub-process http received a segmentation fault.\n```\n\nA `signal 4`, if you run `kill -l` in your terminal, refers to a `SIGILL` being sent to a process to terminate it. `SIGILL` is a signal that means the process performed an \"illegal instruction,\" as you can see if you read `man signal`. It seems that, most often, this signal is triggered when a process attempts to perform an operation that is specific to a processor architecture different from/not supported by your machine's processor.\n\nAnother possibility could be that pieces of the executable code are being overwritten in memory with some other mess of data, or that a function pointer in the program points to similar unintelligible data.\n\nDisclaimer: I literally know next to nothing about this stuff, and I mostly just read about it for a couple hours this morning, so I might be totally wrong. \n\nIf the first case is true, and the sub-process `http` is attempting a processor-specific optimization that is not supported by the processor in the R11, I guess the solution would be to manually compile apt-get (?) on your own machine.\n\nIf the second case is true, and since there's a decent amount of evidence it's related to memory usage, maybe some RAM is being overwritten when `http` still needs to access it? Does that make sense? Or maybe some area of memory is being overwritten or altered or compressed that the `http` process wants to access? The swap functionality on Chromebooks, being enabled by default, does not write to a swap partition on the SSD. Instead, it uses [zram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram), which writes to compressed [block device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file#BLOCKDEV) in RAM, which takes up less memory overall (?) than the normal [paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging) in virtual memory.\n\nSo maybe at high memory usage, zram unknowingly swaps some memory at addresses that the `http` sub-process still needs to access, making it read what seems like garbage data instead, and triggering either an _illegal instruction_ signal (if it thinks the bytes it reads signify an incompatible instruction) or a _segmentation fault_ (because it's accessing/pointing to memory that it's not allowed to access). Maybe disabling swap on the machine will help?\n\nI will try, at some point, to disable swap and see if that helps, and also try recompiling the apt-get binaries (not sure how to do this, but I'm sure I can figure that out) to see if that will work.\n\nAgain, disclaimer, I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense. I'm a chemist, not a computer scientist. I'm sure as hell not a C programmer, and the extent of my knowledge on operating systems reaches only to the Wikipedia pages, Stack Overflow questions, and various forums that I come across when following a Wild Google Chase.\n\nDoes anyone have a better understanding of this?\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

I've put a simple page [here](http://fcoelho.alwaysdata.net/scrapy/page.php) to test the issue. Using a CrawlSpider with a rule like `Rule(SgmlLinkExtractor(), callback='parse_page', follow=True)` will cause this infinite recursion.

{"sentences":"I have to crawl an website that enforces a certain download rate limit for all its URLs, for example, 800 KBytes/sec.\nSince my internet connection is faster than that, accessing the website using my plain web browser and scrapy causes severe delay penalty by the server software. (Using 800 KB/s limit, the download should finish within 30 secs, but if I use unlimited download rates, the server sometimes does not return anything at all, or after a significant artificial delay of 150 secs more or less.)\n\nBefore using scrapy, I was using my home-made crawler with rate limiting.\n\nAfter migrating to scrapy, I have realized that I have to re-implement `scrapy.core.downloader.webclient` stuffs and I need to learn twisted APIs.\n(My first lookup was downloader middlewares, but they seem to be executed _after_ receiving the whole body, unfortunately.)\nThere is an _undocumented_ setting called `DOWNLOADER_HTTPCLIENTFACTORY`, so I could copy & paste the existing classes, extend them, and override this setting.\nI think we can override `rawDataReceived()` in `ScrapyHTTPPageGetter` by inserting calculated delays to limit the receiving rate of the response body traffic, but I think I need more inspection.\n\nCould scrapy be shipped with its native rate limiting feature?\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

It might be the case for scrapy also.\n\nLong story short, how to reproduce the issue:\n- Find a webpage with a form being served with IIS 5.1\n- Create a spider that makes a FormRequest to the form\n- Run the spider\n- Scrapy will keep getting timeouts after sending the POST request\n\nBut forcing HTTP 1.0 by adding\n\n```\nDOWNLOAD_HANDLERS = {\n    'http': 'scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http10.HTTP10DownloadHandler',\n    'https': 'scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http10.HTTP10DownloadHandler',\n}\n```\n\nto settings.py seems to solve the problem.\n\nShouldn't the spider work with the default (HTTP 1.1) handler?\n\nP.S: Using Scrapy 0.20.2 (pip-installed)\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"Currently, Scrapy forces the user to define a spider in order to start scraping any site, but given all execution is centered around requests and callbacks, I think there should be an option to use Scrapy without defining a spider explicitly.\n\nFor instance, below is a subclass of `CrawlerProcess` which allows to start crawling with only an URL and a callback function:\n\n``` python\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess as _CrawlerProcess\nfrom scrapy.http import Request\n\n\nclass CrawlerProcess(_CrawlerProcess):\n    \"\"\"This class allows to crawl an URL with a given callback without explictly creating a spider class.\"\"\"\n\n    def crawl(self, request_or_url, callback=None, crawler_or_spidercls=DefaultSpider,\n              *spider_args, **spider_kwargs):\n        if isinstance(request_or_url, basestring):\n            request_or_url = Request(request_or_url, callback=callback, dont_filter=True)\n        spider_kwargs['start_requests'] = lambda: [request_or_url]\n        super(CrawlerProcess, self).crawl(crawler_or_spidercls, *spider_args, **spider_kwargs)\n```\n\nThen, the example given in www.scrapy.org front page could be written as:\n\n``` python\nimport scrapy\n\ndef parse_blog(response):\n    for url in response.css('ul li a::attr(\"href\")').re(r'/\\d\\d\\d\\d/\\d\\d/$'):\n        yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(url), parse_titles)\n\ndef parse_titles(response):\n    for post_title in response.css('div.entries > ul > li a::text').extract():\n        yield {'title': post_title}\n\ncrawler = CrawlerProcess()\ncrawler.crawl('http://blog.scrapinghub.com', callback=parse_blog)\ncrawler.start()\n```\n\nHowever, this approach misses all the options the `scrapy` command provides, for instance, storing the output of the spider in a file with `-o output.jl`.  And, if the user needs more advanced features, a proper spider class is required in order to take advantage of all the Scrapy features, specially the features that require a specific spider method or attribute.\n\nPD: If anyone likes this idea and wants to contribute, please feel free to provide a PR.\n","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

{"sentences":"I was able to emulate a similar issue touching some settings, I couldn't reproduce it otherwise in the attached project.\n\nProblem here seems unrelated to the system locale. Both log calls, the one in utils/log.py and the one in core/engine.py, try to log an unicode message. By doing that all attributes in the log record are decoded to unicode using the ascii encoding, and that breaks with the reported traceback if there are any non-ascii characters.\n\nThe values in the broken line are roughly:\n\n``` python\n>>> _fmt = '%(asctime)s [%(name)s] %(levelname)s: %(message)s'\n>>> record = {\n    'asctime': '2015-06-02 12:17:01+0000',\n    'created': 1433258457.911135,\n    'exc_info': None,\n    'exc_text': None,\n    'filename': 'log.py',\n    'funcName': 'log_scrapy_info',\n    'levelname': 'INFO',\n    'levelno': 20,\n    'lineno': 108,\n    'module': log,\n    'msecs': 911.1349582672119,\n    'message': u'Scrapy 1.1.0rc1 started (bot: imzx)',\n    'name': 'scrapy',\n    'pathname': 'scrapy/utils/log.py',\n    'process': 19931,\n    'processName': 'MainProcess',\n    'relativeCreated': 66988981.72998428,\n    'thread': 139932245554944,\n    'threadName': 'MainThread'}\n}\n>>> s = _fmt % record\n```\n\nSince `'message'` is unicode, all `'asctime'`, `'name'` and `'levelname'` (and only those) in the record dictionary are going to be casted to unicode using the ascii encoding while formatting them into `_fmt`, which is going to be casted to unicode too. If any of those has non-ascii chars, the conversion is going to break with the UnicodeDecodeError.\n\nProblem is, I don't know how any of those could hold non-ascii characters. The default `'asctime'` format is `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z'`, those placeholders format into numbers regardless locale. All these values are bytestrings handled by us, which are encoded by the default file encoding (ascii in python2) unless stated otherwise at the beginning of the file.\n\nSomething that I tested to trigger these errors was to install scrapy in a path with non-ascii characters, and then change the default format with the LOG_FORMAT setting to `'[%(pathname)s] %(message)s'`. Doing this the logging breaks every time a unicode message is logged, but this is something expected of the python logging since it's using bytestrings internally to store the pathname.\n\n@binbibi, can I ask you to run the following commands (notice the leading `u` in both messages, both calls are logging unicode) and see if any of these calls throws errors? I'm really sorry for the troubles. \n\n``` python\n>>> import logging\n>>> logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s [%(name)s] %(levelname)s: %(message)s')\n>>> logging.warning(u'First log message')\n```\n\n``` python\n>>> import logging\n>>> from scrapy.utils.log import configure_logging\n>>> configure_logging({})\n>>> logger = logging.getLogger('scrapy')\n>>> logger.debug(u'Second message')\n```\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

{"sentences":"Hi Everyone, first of all sorry for creating this distraction, I'm sure you all have plenty of real work to do.  Also @kmike and @redapple, thank you for your productive approach on this, I'll do my best to match your tone.  My main point is to simply make you aware of my experience when I tried to on-board as a contributor.  I ran into a roadblock due to the language of this document, and I wanted to make you aware that using it as a greeting may be having some unintended consequences.  And as I mentioned above, I agree with the high-level goal of encouraging contributors to treat each other with respect, but I'm finding this particular implementation to be a bit buggy.\n\nThe first problem I encountered is that it unnecessarily focuses on lots of negative behavior.  The document provides a list of antisocial activities and a list of classes which should be protected from these activities.  In doing so the document splits the pool of potential contributors into aggressors and victims, and it's up to the reader to figure out where they fit in.  The document also implicitly paints the reader as someone who needs to be warned against engaging in this type of behavior, otherwise it would not be required reading.  This is a fairly pessimistic perspective, and it's somewhat demeaning if you happen to believe that people are innately good.  A more productive approach would be to assume benevolence on the part of all participants, and instead focus on the qualities which make up the ideal contributor.  You will find that the tone of this document becomes much more productive if you take every negative activity that it describes and replace it with its positive counterpart.\n\nThe second problem is that all of this negativity is placed at the beginning of the on-boarding pipeline.  Imagine for a second that you're invited to a friend's house to bake a pie.  And you love pie, so you're really looking forward to helping them improve their recipes.  But when you show up at their house, they greet you with a lecture on politics and morality instead of anything regarding pies.  Then they take you around the house and say things like \"do not kick the cat, do not break the windows, do not make advances toward my grandmother, do not relieve yourself on the floor\".  This language is not appropriate for the situation, it's not a pleasant way to greet someone, and pretty soon you're going to change your mind about the pie.\n\nThe third problem is how it handles conflict resolution between the reporter and the accused.  Many of the problems described in this document will depend on how the reporter perceives the intentions of the accused.  The difference between perception and intent may be due to a misunderstanding, cultural differences, or some other external factor.  Productive conflict resolution would bring both parties to the table and go over the experience of each participant in an effort to bridge their differences.  However, this document prescribes that reporter of an incident should remain anonymous, which is counter to how these things are handled in the real world.\n\n@kmike - You make a fair point regarding the BSD license.  Every project has some amount of boilerplate which serves its purpose in 1-in-1000000 scenarios.  However, the language of the CoC is much less user-friendly than the text you quoted.  If we had to transform one text into the other, then the CoC would read something along the lines of \"We expect all contributors to behave professionally, and treat each other with respect\".  While the BSD text would first describe a list of undesirable products, then a host of unethical activities, and then finally make the point that the contributors do not endorse any of those things. \n\n@redapple - It sounds like you handled those situations appropriately.  I can certainly see how it's useful to have a document that explicitly states the course of action that will be taken in those cases.  Again, my experience is only from the perspective of on-boarding.  Also, the bulk of my response was meant to answer the questions you asked, let me know if you think I'm misinterpreting anything.","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

Downloader uses a small in-memory buffer for requests (its size is equal to CONCURRENT_REQUESTS); it is the component which ensures concurrency limits and download timeouts are respected. Scheduler stores all requests; it can store them either in memory or on disk (see https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html). So request is first retrieved from Scheduler queue, put to Downloader queue, and then Downloader downloads it.\n\n\"Graceful stop\" (a single Ctrl-C) means that a spider stops retrieving requests form Scheduler and waits for Downloader queue to become empty.

{"sentences":"I'm new, so here's a quick intro: Hi! I'm Jakob :) I've also put some thoughts into add-on management for my GSoC proposal.\n\nI don't think Scrapy should continue when there is an error while loading one of the add-ons. Depending on the add-on it probably means a substantial change in functionality (e.g. results are lost when a pipeline add-on fails). The user should be made to explicitly acknowledge that by disabling the add-on herself, not just be informed through a warning message or similar. Instead of marking an add-on as non-critical they might as well start the spider for a second and see if there are any problems.\n\nI'm not sure if there is an advantage in an `AddOn` class: If we force existing extensions (e.g. a pipeline) to subclass it, this would forbid add-ons from using multiple hooks (an add-on could no longer consist of a pipeline _and_ a Spider middleware, etc.). If we make developers define a new class for their addon (subclassing `AddOn`), we might as well make them define a module/`.py` file, thereby enforcing clearer structure (one file/module per addon) and freeing us from having to instantiate the add-on class.\n\nFor the dependency trees, maybe as a first step towards a full-fledged solution the add-ons could be advised to supply some additional variables (besides their name and version), e.g. `REQUIRES`, `MODIFIES`, `PROVIDES`. A rather simple function in the add-on manager could then check whether the requirement of one add-on is in the `MODIFIES` and `PROVIDES` lists other add-ons.\n","labels":{"default":["Positive"]}}

{"sentences":"Currently, if I write a method like this:\n\n```\npublic async Task<int> FooAsync()\n{\n    return 42;\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler emits the following warning:\n\n> This async method lacks 'await' operators and will run synchronously. Consider using the 'await' operator to await non-blocking API calls, or 'await Task.Run(...)' to do CPU-bound work on a background thread\n\nAnd if I look at the IL, I can see that the compiler actually emits a state machine, even tough none is needed.\n\nI think this behavior could be improved.\n- First, the compiler could just emit `return Task.FromResult(42)` (and do the same for every `return x`) if the method body contains no `await`. This would avoid the overhead of creating a state machine.\n- Second, the warning is annoying. The fact that I use `await` or not in the body is just an implementation detail. If I change the implementation so that I no longer need `await`, I have to remove the `async` modifier and change every `return x` to `return Task.FromResult(x)` to avoid the warning. In some cases I could change the method signature to return `T` instead of `Task<T>`, but it's not always possible (e.g. if I'm implementing an interface or overriding a base class method). And if I change the implementation to make it asynchronous again, I have to do the opposite. IMO, the `async` modifier with no `await` should just mean \"implicitly wrap any return value in a completed task\". \n\n`async` without `await` should just be treated as a degenerate case, be optimized as such, and not emit a warning.\n","labels":{"default":["Negative"]}}

When the workspace is trying to read this file, it might get access denied. This results in discrepancy between Error List and actual build output and bogus build errors. This is a bad experience, and a regression from the old language service. We haven't seen this many issues of this nature before Roslyn.\n\nWe could try retrying 10 times spaced out by 200 ms. Or use FileShare.ReadWrite or FileShare.Delete, which are more forgiving than FileShare.Read. Or both.\n\nFrom @Pilchie:\nIn the native C# language service, we used to have a single retry after 1 second which alleviated many of these sort of issues.\n\nFrom @heejaechang:\n\ncurrently, when a workspace try to read a file content, for whatever reason if it fails, it raise workspace failed event and move on. and remains that way until something happens to that file again.\n\nthis is a problem since this could cause a lot of errors to show up in IDE. since those file either contains empty content or staled content from whatever it used to have, this will make some errors to show up for that project, but if there is p2p reference to this project, especially skeleton assembly, then, this could cause even more errors to show up in all those project that transitively depends on this project.\n\nwhat I am observing is when we build or tf sync or even when we load project, if we happen to be out of luck, we gets a lot of this failures and hence a lot of errors in IDE. (I included what I have in my VS right now below)\n\nI think this make IDE experience quite bad. since there is no easy way to fix this once it happens. close solution and re-loading might not fix it sometimes, you need to do that several times sometimes.\n\nso, I think we need a way to mitigate this issue.

{"sentences":"**Version Used**: \nMicrosoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 2.3.2.61928 (ec1cde8b)\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\nCompile the following program in release:\n```C#\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main() { }\n\n    static string Create1(int a, int b, int c) =>\n        string.Format(\n            \"{0} \" +\n            \"{1} \" +\n            \"{2} \",\n            a, b, c);\n\n    static string Create2(int a, int b, int c) =>\n        $\"{a} \" +\n        $\"{b} \" +\n        $\"{c} \";\n}\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\nIn both cases, we'd end up with a single input string and array to the underlying Format call.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\nThe first example results in a single input string and array:\n```\n  IL_0000:  ldstr      \"{0} {1} {2} \"\n  IL_0005:  ldarg.0\n  IL_0006:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32\n  IL_000b:  ldarg.1\n  IL_000c:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32\n  IL_0011:  ldarg.2\n  IL_0012:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32\n  IL_0017:  call       string [System.Runtime]System.String::Format(string,\n                                                                    object,\n                                                                    object,\n                                                                    object)\n````\nbut rather than effectively concatening the interpolations, the second example results in three distinct arrays and format calls, resulting in three intermediate strings that then need to be concatenated:\n```\n  IL_0000:  ldstr      \"{0} \"\n  IL_0005:  ldarg.0\n  IL_0006:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32\n  IL_000b:  call       string [System.Runtime]System.String::Format(string,\n                                                                    object)\n  IL_0010:  ldstr      \"{0} \"\n  IL_0015:  ldarg.1\n  IL_0016:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32\n  IL_001b:  call       string [System.Runtime]System.String::Format(string,\n                                                                    object)\n  IL_0020:  ldstr      \"{0} \"\n  IL_0025:  ldarg.2\n  IL_0026:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32\n  IL_002b:  call       string [System.Runtime]System.String::Format(string,\n                                                                    object)\n  IL_0030:  call       string [System.Runtime]System.String::Concat(string,\n                                                                    string,\n                                                                    string)\n```\nThis is relevant, because splitting string literals across lines with `+` is a common way of avoiding really long lines, and it'd be nice to be able to do the same thing with string interpolation without taking the further perf hit.","labels":{"default":["Neutral"]}}

Unless iterating through the dictionary with a foreach loop - which would be prohibitively expensive when doing a simple look up.  It would be nice if a method could be provided that would return the key/value pair for a given key from a matching \"key\".  The reason why it would be useful is because the Equals method does not necessarily mean that 2 objects are exactly equal - since the Equals method can and often does only use a subset of the fields of a class to make that determination.  I have come across cases where it would have been quite helpful to access the stored key in the dictionary when my code found the item in the dictionary.

But if you changed the second `y` to a `z` then you would not be permitted to use either identifier as neither could be proven to be definitely assigned.\n\nI wouldn't argue for altering that behavior in normal Boolean expressions.  However I do think that pattern matching with `switch` and `match` would be quite handicapped if it didn't have support for both \"OR\" patterns as well as permitting reuse of the identifier where the compiler could prove that the variable could only receive a value from one of the patterns.  Notably F# already supports this with \"OR\" patterns and requires that both sides bind the same set of variables:\n\n``` fsharp\nlet result =\n    match point with\n    | (0, x) | (5, x) -> x\n    | (10, x) | (15, y) -> x // ERROR: The two sides of this 'or' pattern bind different sets of variables\n    | _ -> 0\n```\n\n@alrz Maybe not, but it seems weird to have two ways to express Boolean logic and they apply to completely different places.

Do you want to consider multiple overloads? Excellent! Show a code or explain how the described behaviour works under such conditions. But using a given spec to justify/criticise a completely different situation doesn't seem too correct.\n\n> That's why the compiler allows the code\n\nAgain no. This is a 1-overload scenario, the multiple-overload rules don't apply here. Your spec is applied when determining which overload, out of various ones, should be used. Here there is no possible confusion; just one overload, no doubt about which one to use. \n\nThe following code does illustrate a multi-overload scenario:\n\n``` C#\nprivate static void CallingMethod()\n{\n    //DateTime dateVar = ReturnString(\"\"); //It doesn't compile.\n\n    dynamic dynamicVar = new DateTime(); // \"\";\n    DateTime dateVar = ReturnString(dynamicVar); //Now it compiles.\n}\n\nprivate static string ReturnString(string arg)\n{\n    return arg;\n}\n\nprivate static string ReturnString(DateTime arg)\n{\n    return arg.ToString();\n}\n```\n\nIf you test this code, you would see that there is no confusion here either: `dynamic dynamicVar = new DateTime();` provokes `ReturnString(DateTime arg)` to be selected; and dynamic `dynamicVar = \"\"; ReturnString(string arg)`. There is an error because of trying to store a `string` in a `DateTime` variable, but the overload-selection part works fine. Again this code shouldn't compile (because both methods return a `string` rather than the expected `DateTime` variable) and again it does. So the number of overloads doesn't seem to be an issue here; but you are free to go deeper into all this by considering more complex situations.\n\n> calls to static methods (like in the example you provided), there will be no derived types and so the compiler should be able to catch the error\n\nI am neither sure about what you are trying to say there nor I honestly care.
