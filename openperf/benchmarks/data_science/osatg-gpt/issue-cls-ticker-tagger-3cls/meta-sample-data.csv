__label__bug "Add ability to use PIDs of existing objects Providing a full pid in the `-n` option will ingest an object with that PID; if an object with that PID already exists, the operation is skipped and logged. Problem/bug is, we can only provide a single PID in `-n`, and there could be many object input directories. So we need a way to get PIDs for every object in the input directory.    Work in #5 will let us get a PID from the FOXML, if it is present in the input directory (currently under development). Perhaps we can provide an option indicating that the object input directory encodes the pid. Of course, there are some characters that may exist in PIDs that you don't want in directory names, e.g., `:` on Windows), so they should be URL-encoded.        "

__label__bug "Issue triggering old pre-compiled synthdefs in v3.9 I tried to throw  `v3.9-beta1` into Sonic Pi but ran into an issue triggering the pre-compiled synthdefs. This behaviour can be reproduced with vanilla SuperCollider:    ```  s = Server.new  s.boot  //   s.sendMsg( '/d_loadDir', ""/Users/sam/Development/sonic-pi/etc/synthdefs/compiled/tmp/"" );   s.sendMsg(""/s_new"", ""sonic-pi-beep"", x = s.nextNodeID, 1, 1);  ```    Where the `tmp` directory contains a single synthdef:    https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/master/etc/synthdefs/compiled/sonic-pi-beep.scsyndef    EDIT (Brian): v1 file here: https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/36496b69e7e821562c6608a276b4536229d38250/etc/synthdefs/compiled/sonic-pi-beep.scsyndef    The behaviour I observe is that scsynth silently dies when attempting to trigger the synthdef.    This may be because support for the older synthdef byte code has been deprecated? Sonic Pi's synthdefs are compiled with Overtone, which hasn't yet been updated to support the latest byte code format.     If support for older synthdefs has been deprecated, it would be nice for SuperCollider to not silently die and instead print a warning explaining that the older byte code format has been deprecated - it should also probably listed as a breaking change in the release notes :-)        "

I have an older install, so it looks like it tries to start some previously uncomplete/failed downloads while iterating through my claims. This could be part of a bigger issue, I'll see if I can get it to reproduce in other ways.  Couple examples where this happens are in the logs at the end.     ### Steps to reproduce  1. Start Daemon  2. Check logs for errors  3. See Key error after previously failed downloads try to start.     ### Expected behaviour  Error more gracefully?    ### Actual behaviour  KeyError      ## System Configuration    <!-- For the app, this info is in the About section at the bottom of the Help page.

__label__bug "[4.0.0-beta.7] Reloading in deep component leads to reloading the whole state (root component) I have pretty big project with a lot of decorators. In v3 reloading in a deep and independent component leaded to reload only that component. Now if I reload `<Footer/>`, the whole `<App/>` will be reloaded as well.  My rough code structure:    ```  import {hot} from 'react-hot-loader';  import React from 'react';  import {render} from 'react-dom';  import {Provider, connect} from 'react-redux';  import {BrowserRouter, withRouter} from 'react-router-dom';  import App from './App';  import store from './App/store';  const HotApp = hot(module)(App);    const HotConnectedApp = () => (    <Provider store={store}>      <BrowserRouter>        <HotApp/>      </BrowserRouter>    </Provider>  );    render(    <HotConnectedApp/>,    document.getElementById('root'),  );    @withRouter  @connect(...)  class App extends Component {    state = {      initialFetchWasMade: false,    };      componentWillMount() {      this.makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent();    }        makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent = () => {      setTimeout(        () => this.setState(() => ({initialFetchWasMade: true})),        3000,      );    };        render() {      const {initialFetchWasMade} = this.state;      if (initialFetchWasMade) return <Spinner/>;      return (        <div>          <Header/>          <Footer/>        </div>      );    }  }  ```    Now, if I make a change in `<Footer/>`, the whole `<App/>` reloads and `makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent` is called every time (and it takes pretty long time sometimes).   In v3 only `<Footer/>` was reloaded.    Is it a known bug? Should I create a repro?"

__label__bug MbTiles unit tests don't work with .NET Standard Unit testing of SQLite functionality has always been complicated by the dependency on native libraries.

While the specific modification (i.e. replacing it with cleaned `$ACT`) is not wrong per se, it unnecessarily breaks other plugins that are listening for their own `?do=` key, if that key includes uppercase letters.    suggested fix:  1) use early return before modifying any globals if this isn't the plugin's action  2) use only `$event->data`, not `$ACT`"

__label__bug "Sorting Configuration Wizard columns, entities, and value Not possible Note: @pgathogo You have not much to do here as the title suggests. :D @pgathogo and @gkahiu I know sorting and re-ordering of items in the wizard that are added in the db or written to configuration.stc might be a bit difficult or imppossible. However, it could be possible to sort items also reflect in the database and configuration.stc before they are created.   Currently, it is possible to change the order of items is by just editing them so that they are pushed to last in the list. As a default behavior it is good but this might not be desirable in some case. For instance, if a user has created 10 columns and wants the first one to be first_name. Then if he/she decides to make edits to first_name column after all columns are created, the first_name will be the last column. To make it the first column again, the user has to edit all others so that the first_name can be first in the list. This is a bit tedious.   Considering the time I have, I decide to add a drag and drop sort feature so it is used by the Configuration Wizard. I add it under [utils/util.py](https://github.com/gltn/stdm/blob/ref_config_mod/utils/util.py#L711) so that other modules can use it. In addition to the wizard, this feature can enhance other modules such as Document Generator and the Import Wizard. I have already incorporated the feature in Document Generator in t[his commit](https://github.com/gltn/stdm/commit/ab8499531c90ca1acd8298c210755f8e3f4a547b) but I didn't incorporate it to the Import Wizard considering the time. It can be incorporated in STDM 2.0.   I feel it would be great to incorporate the sort feature in the Configuration Wizard. You can implement it in the Entities creation page, the columns, and lookup values.   The method is tested on QTableView and QListView so you just need to do the following to add it in the wizard.   ```  from stdm.utils.util import enable_drag_sort  # In a code block where you target new profiles with no configuration and db enable_drag_sort(self.tbvColumns) enable_drag_sort(self.lvLookupValues) enable_drag_sort(self.pftableView) ``` "

__label__bug "Memory leak with MPI_Alloc_mem ## Background information  I have found what appears to be a memory leak within OpenMPI. This was seen in a CFD code we use in our research group, which uses the Boost MPI library. As part of its serialization of std::vectors, Boost makes use of MPI_Alloc_mem (balanced by MPI_Free_mem), and this appears to be the cause of a memory leak which eventually results in some of our simulations crashing due to lack of memory.    ### OpenMPI versions affected  v2.1.2 and v3.0.0 have the problem described below. v1.10.7 does not.    ### System and OpenMPI installation  Both the above versions were compiled from source  Platform: Ubuntu 16.04  Hardware: Intel 64-bit  Compiler: gcc-5.4.0 (default as on Ubuntu 16.04)  Configure flags:  ./configure --prefix=/local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install    ## Minimal example  The short program below exhibits the problem:  ```c++  #include <mpi.h>    int main(void)  {    int i=0;    MPI_Init(&i, NULL);      char* result;    for(size_t i=0 ; i < 10000 ; i++)    {      MPI_Alloc_mem(100, MPI_INFO_NULL, &result);      MPI_Free_mem(result);    }    MPI_Finalize();  }  ```    ### Compilation  /local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install/bin/mpicc  ./memory_leak_check_minimal.C -o ./memory_leak_check_minimal-3.0.0 -g  -O0  ### Testing  valgrind --tool=massif --threshold=0.1 --detailed-freq=1  ./memory_leak_check_minimal-3.0.0    Then, ms_print --threshold=0.1 ./massif.out shows:  ```  ->62.52% (1,615,768B) 0x59F6D75: opal_free_list_grow_st (in  /local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install/lib/libopen-pal.so.40.0.0)  ```  near the beginning, and  ```  ->80.07% (4,312,304B) 0x59F6D75: opal_free_list_grow_st (in  /local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install/lib/libopen-pal.so.40.0.0)  ```  near the end of the test-run (the final mentions of  opal_free_list_grow_st show that the memory is eventually freed, but  probably by MPI_Finalize()).    I have tested the same program against MPICH 3.2.1 and it doesn't have the memory leak."

__label__bug "Perform bool to uint8_t conversion at the notation level For @JasonGross, by way of a discussion with me and @andres-erbsen. Any mistakes in the transcription are mine.    The synthesized code works with one-bit integers a lot for carries and the like. This is nominally a `bool`, but C didn't get support for this until C99, so instead things got rounded up to `uint8_t` at some point down the line. This was done by way of making `TWord 3` a `uint8_t` while leaving `TWord 0` a `bool`, then somewhere telling the bounds-checker to round to `TWord 3` instead of `TWord 0`.    This has two problems. First, the unused `TWord 0` notations are not actually correct. Adding two `bool`s together is *not* addition mod 2. It is actually saturating. It's because C first casts the two `bool`s to `int`, adds them, and casts back down to `bool` by checking `2 != 0`.    Second, converting to `TWord 3` forces `AddWithCarry` and `SubWithBorrow` implementations to be pessimistic. They must take in a full 8 bits of precision in the carry bit and output 8 bits. This means one can't use the [real compiler intrinsics](https://software.intel.com/en-us/cpp-compiler-18.0-developer-guide-and-reference-addcarry-u32-addcarry-u64), which treat any non-zero input as a 1. Also, for instance, [this](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/11850d5f618f2e39ad80fedb42feafa9047330b7/third_party/fiat/p256.c#65) `subborrow_u64` implementation isn't correct.    The effect is particularly pronounced for, say, `addcarryx_u26` and `subborrow_u26`. In theory, these could be implemented as:    ```  static uint8_t addcarryx_u26(uint8_t c, uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t *low) {    uint32_t x = a + b + c;    *low = x & ((1 << 26) - 1);    return (x >> 26) & 1;  }    static uint8_t subborrow_u26(uint8_t c, uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t *low) {    uint32_t x = a - b - c;    *low = x & ((1 << 26) - 1);    return x >> 31;  }  ```    These functions need only extract 26+1 = 27 bits of output, so a `uint32_t` is a sufficient temporary. However, if the `uint8_t` output is treated as a true `uint8_t`, rather than a stand-in for a `uint1_t`, we need 26+8 = 34 bits of output, and we must go up a word size, even though that's not actually necessary.    Proposal:    1. Fix the `TWord 0` notations to, rather than using `bool`, which doesn't work, use `uint8_t` with manual truncations. So, adding two bools would be `uint8_t c = (a + b)&1`. (Though I'd be surprised if you ever emitted that one.)    2. Remove the `TWord 0` to `TWord 3` conversion and leave all `TWord 0`s as-is.    3. Remove the `TWord 3` notation cases for `addcarryx` and `subborrow`. Only select those intrinsics when the carry bits are `TWord 0`.          "
__label__bug "Make `Streamers`' `iterate()` return a copy of the streamer As identified in #111, when activated, each `Streamer` generator maintains the state of the original object. This is a bug in situations such as `PoissonMux(mode='with_replacement')`, where the stream can be used multiple times. (See discussion in #111 for more details).    Proposals for fixing:  * Have the context manager make a copy of the streamer to activate, which is then used instead of `self` within the context.    Questions / Clarifications:  * Is returning a shallow copy sufficient?  * Option for deep copy? (i.e. `deep=True/False`)  * Maybe provide an option in `.iterate()` to set whether a copy happens or not, for the following case identified by @bmcfee:  > ... I think it's fair to expect each streamer (reference) to behave independently. *Where this gets really nasty is when stacking muxen, which could have deep state to copy.*  "

__label__bug "Internal and Internet-Facing Aws-Load-Balancer-Scheme Cannot Coexist I just experienced an issue where the Ingress Controller doesn't create an internal/internet-facing ALB stack when the other type already exists.    **How to Reproduce**:  1. Create an ingress with the internet-facing ingress with ""zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internal"" annotation.  2. Create another ingress for the same domain (not the same host) but with ""zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing"" annotation (or without any annotations at all, internet-facing being the default).     **Expected**:   A new stack gets created as the first one cannot be used due to the fact that it's of a  different scheme.    **What Happens**:  The Ingress Controller doesn't create a new stack and reports the following in its logs:     ```  2017/12/21 20:55:53 Start polling sleep 30s  2017/12/21 20:56:23 Found 2 ingresses  2017/12/21 20:56:23 Found 1 stacks  2017/12/21 20:56:23 Have 1 models  2017/12/21 20:56:23 updated ingress not needed default/my-first-internal-app with DNS name ""internal-k8s-the-rest-of-aws-alb-name""  2017/12/21 20:56:23 updated ingress not needed default/my-internet-facing-app with DNS name ""internal-k8s-the-rest-of-aws-alb-name""  ```  Note that the ALB DNS is that of the original ALB created for the first ""internal"" app.    I'm using the latest image for the controller:  registry.opensource.zalan.do/teapot/kube-ingress-aws-controller:latest    Here're the Ingress manifests:     **Internal**:  ```yaml  apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1  kind: Ingress  metadata:    name: ""my-first-internal-app""    annotations:      zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internal    namespace: default    labels:      app: ""my-first-internal-app""  spec:    rules:    - host: ""my-first-internal-app.mydomain.com""      http:        paths:        - backend:            serviceName: ""my-first-internal-app""            servicePort: 80  ```    **Internet-Facing**:  ```yaml  apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1  kind: Ingress  metadata:    name: ""my-internet-facing-app""    annotations:      zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing    namespace: default    labels:      application: ""my-internet-facing-app""  spec:    rules:    - host: ""my-internet-facing-app.mydomain.com""      http:        paths:        - backend:            serviceName: ""my-internet-facing-app""            servicePort: 80  ```      I also tried omitting the annotation altogether for the seconds manifest.

__label__bug "bearer interceptor being created before keycloak.init Hello again,    I have just upgraded to 1.2.1, to get the new changes, hoping to fix the #4 issue, but now I'm facing a new one. This time I'm not sure where the problem is.    The `KeycloakBearerInterceptor` is constructed before my initialization code (`keycloak.init()`), where I define the `bearerExcludedUrls` option.    In the constructor we have this:    ```  var excludedUrls = this.keycloak.getBearerExcludedUrls();  this.excludedUrlsRegex = excludedUrls.map(function (urlPattern) { return new RegExp(urlPattern, 'gi'); });  ```    So the `excludedUrlsRegex` variable is set before my initialization function is called, and afterwards, during an intercept, the original, empty, `excludedUrlsRegex` is used.    Just to have something working, I have moved those two lines to the beginning of the intercept method, so it uses the latest `this.keycloak.getBearerExcludedUrls()`.    Now... I'm kinda new to Angular2+, so maybe I have done something wrong on my side. What do you think? Is it possible to make my initialization code run before the construction of the interceptor?      "

__label__bug "Filter Component keeps the simple search rule when deleting the search text ## Expected Behavior  When clearing the simple search filter's input, then the underlying filter should be removed.     ## Actual Behavior  When clearing the simple search filter's input, then the underlying filter remains in the internal memory structures and used for determining the filter's count presented to the user.  Even though an empty string filter doesn't affect the results (since `includes()` returns `true`) the filter object in held in memory and can even be stored as part of a view.

__label__bug "Git log for a file is has all changes which involve submodules too  - [x] I was not able to find an [open](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues?q=is%3Aopen) or [closed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) issue matching what I'm seeing    ### Setup     - Which version of Git for Windows are you using? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit?    ```  $ git --version --build-options  git version 2.13.0.windows.1  built from commit: eba7af3dbb4c846c6303c5f64102acee696c9ab0  sizeof-long: 4  machine: x86_64  ```     - Which version of Windows are you running? Vista, 7, 8, 10? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit?  Windows 10 FCU    ```  $ cmd.exe /c ver  Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.64]  ```     - What options did you set as part of the installation? Or did you choose the     defaults?    ```  # One of the following:  > type ""C:\Program Files\Git\etc\install-options.txt""  $ cat /etc/install-options.txt  Path Option: CmdTools                SSH Option: OpenSSH                  CURL Option: OpenSSL                 CRLF Option: CRLFAlways              Bash Terminal Option: ConHost        Performance Tweaks FSCache: Enabled  Use Credential Manager: Enabled      Enable Symlinks: Enabled             ```     - Any other interesting things about your environment that might be related     to the issue you're seeing?    Using ConEmu.    ### Details     - Which terminal/shell are you running Git from? e.g Bash/CMD/PowerShell/other    Bash, CMD, Powershell, WSL Bash     - What commands did you run to trigger this issue? If you can provide a     [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)     this will help us understand the issue.    I'm filing this issue from this stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47185944/git-log-with-square-bracket-in-name    Reproduce it by:  * running this [shell-script](https://gist.github.com/kumarharsh/e1948c6971f1c68577792ff914a00af7) in WSL or git bash.  And then,    ```  1. Open powershell, type `git log .\[__Odd__].txt`  2. Open CMD, type `git log ./""[__Odd__].txt""`  3. Open WSL bash, type `git log ./\[__Odd__\].txt`  4. Still in WSL, type `git.exe log ./\[__Odd__\].txt`  ```       - What did you expect to occur after running these commands?    All git log outputs should have been the same.     - What actually happened instead?    The output of 1, 2, 4 is different from the output of 3. The output of 3 is correct (git log should not show changes for submodules while viewing git log for a particular file). Hence, it follows that git-for-windows' `git.exe` might have a bug.     - If the problem was occurring with a specific repository, can you provide the     URL to that repository to help us with testing?    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47185944/git-log-with-square-bracket-in-name  "

This is a bad approach. While we can introspect all Haskell values in a secondary thread without troubles, wlroots may free some C objects while we iterate them (e.g. output modes).    Libfuse can be integrated into our mainloop, with the `session_read_buffer` and `session_dispatch_buffer` (or similar, let me be lazy) but HFuse doesn't currently export those properly.  This approach would be better than the current hack.    When this is done, the mount/unmount should probably also be moved into a `Control.Exception.bracket` like construct, so it triggers deterministicly when we exit the compositor."

__label__bug "Tags for including Bootstrap4 I'm thinking of removing the template tags for inclusion of JS and CSS. When using local source/dist a dev should know what to include, may use webpack or another tool to combine static files, et cetera. So the only viable use case for including through tags would be CDN. This would burden us with keeping up with Bootstrap releases to adjust CDN URL's and signatures.    Any input on this matter?"

__label__bug "Component not accepted by Hot Loader if using react-refetch Hi! congrats on v3!  I have been trying to switch from `react-transform-hmr` to `react-hot-loader@3`and facing some issues. It looks like I can't get Hot Loader to properly works with components wrapped with https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch HOC (and since my parent App component is also wrapped, none on the children components are accepted)    ```  React Hot Loader: this component is not accepted by Hot Loader.

__label__bug "Database stores unchanged language strings I have a number of language issue which I have outlined numerous times the last #1789.     I am still having issues with saving changes to db and now to Merge File.      To nut this out, for now I am not concerned about main language files, I am only concerned with Plugin language files.    After installing plugin (any), I then wish to change language files.    I select Language from Main Menu and it loads the list of Languages installed then click on EDIT ICON for the Language I wish to change and loads the Languages Module.    I then select the plugin I wish to change and it CREATES a language file (language.xml) for the selected language in plugin_name/languages folder and loads Languages page for me to make EDITS.    I make the EDITS to the fields I only want EDITED (the Language String Name field background turns green and a Edit Icon appears next to String Textbox) and SAVE.  This always works the 1st time I do this for ANY Language and saves ALL (both unedited and edited) languages fields for the Plugin in db.    All good so far, although I cannot see the need to save UNEDITED fields.    Before going to another Language, lets Merge File firstly.    Here is issue.    I am confronted with 1 option - Write over original language file (language.xml).    If CHECKED it writes these to to language.xml in main /languages folder and NOT to languages.xml in plugin_name/languages folder?      If left UNCHECKED it CREATES a new file language-custom.xml in main languages folder.    Neither method Merges File to plugin_name/languages/languages.xml, but lets continue with the above.    Having Merged File, what is point of having these in DB? so I manually DELETE these from db as it should work from the Merged Files from above.    Having cleared both Language and Browser caches, I go to Store to see changes BUT none are shown.    So I ask a question?    Plugins Language files do not work from main languages.xml file, so why the the need to be Merged here when it does not work?  Also if I Delete plugin, it does not Remove these entries from languages.xml file.  So in effect Merging to here is pretty much pointless and useless.  Similarly with language-custom.xml, what is its purpose, when it also does nothing?     Merge File should merge to plugin_name/languages/languages.xml which works correctly when I manually move these here to test and not to languages folder as it currently does.      There is NO need for the current Option, although I would like to see Option (checkbox) to Delete DB entries after it merges file to modules/plugins/plugin_name/languages/languages.xml which was created earlier as outlined above.    Moving on, now I want to I want to change language fields for same plugin BUT for a different language.    I follow above method but select a different language and make same same changes as 1st language, it DOES NOT always SAVE these changes to db and if Merge File was working correctly as these have not been saved to db it will not merge edited language strings to file.    Got me baffled, although I do have a more appropriate f word I can use."

__label__bug "Combined mutation reader produces range tombstones which do not overlap with the query range in some cases Since: 1.4, but impacts cache reads only since 2.0    When we get two range tombstones with the same lower bound from different data sources (e.g. two sstable), which need to be combined into a single stream, e.g. when populating cache, they need to be de-overlapped, because each mutation fragment in the stream must have a different position. If we have range tombstones `[1, 10)` and `[1, 20)`, the result of that de-overlapping will be `[1, 10)` and `[10, 20]`. The problem is that if the stream corresponds to a clustering slice with upper bound greater than `1`, but lower than `10`, the second range tombstone would appear as being out of the query range. This is currently violating assumptions made by some consumers, like cache populator.    One effect of this may be that a reader will miss rows which are in the range `(1, 10)` (after the start of the first range tombstone, and before the start of the second range tombstone), if the second range tombstone happens to be the last fragment which was read for a discontinuous range in cache **and** we stopped reading at that point because of a full buffer **and** cache was evicted before we resumed reading, so we went to reading from the sstable reader again. There could be more cases in which this violation may resurface.    Possible solutions:    1) relax the assumption (in cache) that streams contain only relevant range tombstones, and only require that they contain at least all relevant tombstones    1) allow subseqent range tombstones in a stream to share the same starting position (position is weakly monotonic), then we don't need to de-overlap the tombstones in readers.      1) teach combining readers about query restrictions so that they can drop fragments which fall outside the range    1) force leaf readers to trim all range tombstones to query restrictions    I'm in favor of doing 2, because it would simplify combining readers, which wouldn't need to accumulate and trim range tombstones. That includes the cache reader.    I don't like solution 3, because it makes combining readers more complicated, slower, and harder to properly construct (currently combining readers don't need to know restrictions of the leaf streams).    Solution 4 is confined to implementations of leaf readers, but also has disadvantage of making those more complicated and slower.  "

Here is what I wrote.     ```  fastify.use((request, reply, next) => {      if (request.url.substr(-1) == '/' && request.url.length > 1) {          reply.redirect(request.url.slice(0, -1));          return;      }      next();  })  ```    Hitting my url ""/api/test"" works and gets me my data. But when I hit /api/test/ I get that .redirect is not a method. reply.redirect returns undefined.    When I create a route, for example:    ```  fastify.get(/'hello', (request, reply)=>{   console.dir(reply.redirect);  });  ```    I get that 'redirect' is indeed a function.    Am I doing something wrong? Or is the redirect simply not available for middlewares (when using .use())? I tried wrapping the middleware in fastify.ready() but still no success, in fact, the middleware doesn't run at all. It could be that maybe I didn't read something right, so any directions or help would be appreciated. Really don't want to add the middleware to every single route. Thanks! "

We fist need to handle the special limits events in busboy here,  https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#busboy-special-events  and reject the promise if any of those are raised.  2. And the inner promise should reject if the mapFieldname does not match the fieldName,  ```  if (fieldName === mapFieldname) { // }  else { reject(new Error(`Field name mismatches ${fieldName} !== ${mapFieldname}`));  ```  3. I guess we should resolve the top level promise only on the busboy finish event.    And finally maybe the request.pipe/busboy might have some error events which need to consumed and reject the promise for safety sake.  "

__label__bug "[C#] AnimationPlayer doesn't work with C# properties. **Godot version:**  3.0 b2      **OS/device including version:**  Windows 10      **Issue description:**  The AnimationPlayer node works fine with C# fields, but doesn't seem to work with C# properties. For instance, the following works fine in GDScript:  ```swift  extends Node2D    export(int) var frame = 0 setget _set_frame  	  func _set_frame(f):  	frame = f  	var children = get_children()  	for c in children:  		if c is Sprite:  			c.set_frame(frame)  ```  But the same code in C# doesn't seem to work at all:  ```csharp  using Godot;  using System;    public class Armor : Node2D  {      private int frame;      [Export]      public int Frame {          get { return frame; }          set {              frame = value;              object[] children = GetChildren();              foreach (object c in children) {                  if (c is Sprite) {                      ((Sprite)c).Frame = frame;                  }              }          }      }  }  ```  When I try to do this, the following error arises: ```Failed setting track value 'Armor:Frame'. Check if property exists or the type of key is valid...```  In this particular case, I have a workaround, but I think that C# properties should absolutely be supported in AnimationPlayer.  "

__label__bug "Bug: Tabbed complex list does not set height correctly ## Bug  When editing a complex list in a tabbed overlay, the overlay background is collapsed to the height of the header. The contents are still visible on a transparent background. This only happens when the complex list does not appear in the first tab of the overlay.    When the complex list is in the first tab of the overlay the background does not collapse, but when the add/remove buttons cause an item to expand the list overflows outside the overlay background.    ## Reproduction steps  1) Add a new component which has a complex list in a tabbed overlay (complex dropdown in `sites`)  2) Select the complex list tab, the ""add items"" button is shown  3) Select ""add items"". The item is added, the overlay background briefly expands to contain it before collapsing down to the header height  4) Close the overlay. Reopen it, select the tab with the complex list. The overlay is the correct height  5) Select ""add another"". The item is added, the overlay collapses again.  "

Using the macro inserted `UpdateTool`, not the chosen `UpdateToolBar`!  So I re-recorded the macro using `Ctrl+n`, the Vim auto completion, but the result was not better at all. With using the macro `UpdateTol` was inserted, instead of `UpdateToolBar`, because I mistyped the character `l` after hitting `Ctrl+n`, used `Back` to delete the mistyped character `l` letting VsVim auto complete to the correct text.

__label__bug "Country Code issue A bit of an odd issue. If I receive an SMS message, number is being recognized, I can display it in a popup window (SMS App) and respond. However, when I then check my phone, those messages are not sent, even though they appear in a correct conversation. If I pick a contact from the list in SMS App and send message this way, it is being sent correctly. The only difference is that when message arrives and I respond to it, it has a phone number prefixed with country code (+44 for UK). When I send it after picking a contact from the list, it only ha a 0 prefix. So I guess my phone app is picky when it comes to sending SMS to a number with country code prefix. If I add the country prefix with 00 instead of + (so 0044 instead of +44) it all works well. Is it possible to add feature that will convert + to 00? it would mean that I could have my conversation in a single window in SMS App."

__label__bug "ALL asset-delete buttons show ""delete this sprite?"" dialog ### Expected Behavior    When clicking on an ""X"" button, the message displayed is based on what is being deleted. For example:    * ""Are you sure you want to delete this sound?"" when deleting a sound  * ""Are you sure you want to delete this sprite?"" when deleting a sprite  * ""Are you sure you want to delete this costume?"" when deleting a costume  * (etc for backdrops and such)    ### Actual Behavior    The displayed prompt's message is always ""Are you sure you want to delete this sprite?"".    Though these dialogs are almost certainly temporary (i.e. they will be replaced by custom popup dialogs), the cause of the issue is still worth noting.    This problem stems from all asset [`Selector`s](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/blob/64891259b1f58696208b20a46df917e58005a6b0/src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx) using the [`SpriteSelectorItem`](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/blob/64891259b1f58696208b20a46df917e58005a6b0/src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx#L23) class. It doesn't really make sense to have costume items using the sprite selector item; there should probably be a more generic parent class (ex. `SelectorItem`) that `SpriteSelectorItem`, and potential sound/costume-backdrop classes, inherit from.    ### Steps to Reproduce    1. View the ""sounds"" or ""costumes"" tab.  2. Click on the ""X"" button inside a sound or costume's icon.  3. Read the dialog text that pops up.    ### Operating System and Browser    macOS 10.12.5, Chrome 58.0.3029.110  "

__label__bug Ember-Data 2.14.10 application bug The latest ember-data version _2.14.10_ results in a buggy application-rendering. Somehow only the foundation and the guard package of our Neo4j dummy app are rendered.     The foundation is not a component of our model (it is added / removed when needed for rendering). Therefore only one actual package (component) is rendered (the Guard package).     I think @thacau showed me this problem in his VR-approach first.

It should instead return nil.    This happens because the text method invokes apply_subs without first checking whether the value of the text property is nil. While the text property is never nil for normal list items, it can be nil for a description details node that only contains blocks.

__label__bug Runtime crashes when trying to debug application with --start option When trying to debug application with the `--start` option the first debug session is OK. If I start the debugger again without restarting the application on the device - the runtime crashes.  After some investigation I found that this call -> https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-runtime/blob/master/src/debugging/TNSDebugging.h#L77 causes the crash. If I remove the error check the debugger will not start but the third time I start debugging with `--start` it works.    Steps to reproduce:  1. `tns create debug-test`  2. `cd debug-test`  3. Deploy the application and start it.  4. `tns debug ios --start --chrome`  5. Open the debug url.  6. After the Chrome DevTools are loaded and the application can be debugged - stop the debug command and close the DevTools tab. Don't restart the application on the device.  7. `tns debug ios --start --chrome`  8. Open the debug url.  9. The application crashes on the device.
__label__bug "A global ``.docutils`` smart_quotes setting overrides html_use_smartypants or extension setting Consider situation [mentioned](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3967#issuecomment-339408120) by @matthew-brett: user has a ``~/.docutils`` file which activates or deactivates smart_quotes.    Then this will override Sphinx's own setting either from (deprecated)  html_use_smartypants, or from an extension which would initiate a `smart_quotes` setting (cf ee52c7cd4f5e0a300c8fdd897c9529f5c633c7ed). This is bad because it is to be expected that a local setting overrides a global one.    Also, the setting in a `docutils.conf` file will override one set by an extension despite ee52c7cd.    Thus if we want to deactivate by default smart quotes for some builders (man, text, cf #4357), via a simple-minded usage of a `'smart_quotes'` setting as in ``environment/__init__.py`` this will fail is this issue is not fixed first.    One can test this by creating a ``$HOME/.doctutils`` file with    ```  [parsers]  	smart_quotes=no  ```    and use `html_use_smartypants = True` in `conf.py`. No smart quotes will be applied.    Or set ``smart_quotes=yes`` in Docutils user config file and `html_use_smartypants = False` in `conf.py` of local Sphinx project then smart quotes will be applied.    ### Environment info  - OS: Mac  - Python version: 3.6.4  - Sphinx version: 1.6.5, stable, master    Relates #4112"
__label__bug "inconsistency between the push and += operators with lists the `push` and `+=` operators work differently in corner cases involving lists; if there is an uninitialized lvalue declared as `list` or `softlist`, both operators implicitly initialize the lvalue as a list and then perform the list add operation.    In case the lvalue is `*list` or `*softlist`, the behavior is different:    ```  david@greybeard:~/src/qore/git/qore/build$ qore -ne '*list l; push l, 1; printf(""%y\n"", l);'  null  david@greybeard:~/src/qore/git/qore/build$ qore -ne '*list l; l += 1; printf(""%y\n"", l);'  unhandled QORE System exception thrown in TID 1 at 2018-01-06 07:51:38.848521 Sat +01:00 (CET) at <command-line>:1  RUNTIME-TYPE-ERROR: <lvalue> expects type '*list', but got type 'integer' instead  ```    There is also the case where the push command will perform changes in complex lvalue expressions without actually performing any push operation:  ```  david@greybeard:~/src/qore/git/qore/build$ qore -ne 'hash h;  push h.a, 1;  push h.a, 2;  printf(""%y\n"", h);  '  {a: null}  ```    My suggestion is to modify the `push` operator to throw an exception in other cases when no operation can be performed to align with the `+=` operator instead of silently failing.    another related example of `push` silently failing:  ```  qore -ne 'auto l = 1; push l, 2; printf(""%y\n"", l);'  1  ```    "

__label__bug "Use rappdirs for saving temporary files For [saving log files](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/blob/7242a340986fa518b7f35e15de488d2853ea587d/R/wflow_build.R#L150) and creating temporary directories for unit tests, I  am using `/tmp`. The advantage of this approach over using `tempdir()` is that 1) the filepath is easier to read and type into a Terminal, and 2) it persists after the current R session ends. But of course the main downside is that `/tmp` doesn't really exist on Windows, and thus making the code work cross-platform is more difficult. From `?tempdir`:    ```  tempdir() # works on all platforms with a platform-dependent result  ```    To get this to work, I've had to write some [uncomfortably hacky code](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/blob/7242a340986fa518b7f35e15de488d2853ea587d/tests/testthat/test-wflow_start.R#L26).    This has been on my to-do list to fix, but I recently found a bigger problem with this approach. When Joyce or I run workflowr on the same partition on Midway, the directory `/tmp/workflowr` is owned by one of us. Thus when `wflow_build()` tries to create the log files and `/tmp/workflowr` is owned by the other person, it fails.    My plan is to use [rappdirs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rappdirs). It finds the path for saving temporary files for each operating system. I can save the log files in `user_log_dir()` and the temporary directories for unit testing in `user_data_dir()`. As an example on Midway:    ```  > library(""rappdirs"")  > user_cache_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.cache/workflowr""  > user_config_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.config/workflowr""  > user_data_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.local/share/workflowr""  > user_log_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.cache/workflowr/log""  ```    Note that I'll need to also need to specify the argument `appauthor = Sys.info()[""user""]`, which is used on Windows and safely ignored on Unix-alike systems."

I'm using ""@ngx-formly/bootstrap"": ""^2.0.0-rc.6"".    Example:  [https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fqxpmq](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fqxpmq)  You can see that label of required fields is in black color after validation. It should be in red.

If it succeeds it gives you an event which decreases the popularity of Syndicalists, Totalists and Radical Socialists by 100 %. This does not change anything at all since both the syndicalists and the totalists will continue to gain party popularity until both of them reach 20 % or 40 % in total. That also means that the player won't be able to reach more than 60 % party popularity and therefore won't ever be able to achieve High Party Popularity when he decides to stay democratic or decides to go down the ""Enemies on all sides"" focus branch.    Furthermore it's weird that the syndicalists and the totalists would continue to gain party popularity even though their stronghold, the Romandie, has been taken by France.    - [no] Do you have this issue in vanilla?  - [no] Were you in multiplayer?  - [yes] Were you running other mods (music mod doesn't count)?

__label__bug "Login form detection does not work correctly on injected login page While looking for other examples for issue #42, I noticed that theverge.com is also behaving weirdly.  The login page there seems to be injected via JS after clicking the login button.    ## Expected Behavior  Username and password fields should behave like on all other sites.    ## Current Behavior  After clicking the login-button, the username and password fields are not recognized as such. There is no possibility to fill my credentials.  After switching to another tab and back to the theverge.com-tab, my credentials are listed in the KeePassXC Browser Plugin window in the navigation bar. When clicking the entry in the browser plugin, the credentials are filled and my username appears in the normal ""username selection field"" below the username field:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374166/33998987-7c60b730-e0e9-11e7-8292-4fd23d901d69.png)    When clicking the username, the login page closes unexpectedly.  When using the tab-button instead, I can see that the password field is also filled correctly.    ## Possible Solutions  This is probably very specific to how this login page on theverge.com is implemented.  The login page probably closes because the username-selection field is detected as ""outside"" of the login form. As a user, I feel compelled to click on my username again because the selection field hides the password field and I do not see that the password is already filled as well. Maybe the username selection field does not need to be shown when the credentials are filled from the extension-window.    ## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)  1. Create a password entry for https://www.theverge.com  2. Open theverge.com  3. Click the useraccount-icon or the ""Log In"" button  4. Notice that the username/password fields are not recognized  5. Switch to another tab and back again  6. Click the KeePassXC-browser-icon and choose the credential to fill the login form  7. Click the username below the username field (see screenshot above).    ## General Info  keepassxc-browser - 0.4.3    Operating system: Windows 10  Browser: Nightly  Proxy used: YES  "

However, if they try again and use the correct password and the right token immediately after, it works.    When the journalist makes a mistake entering the password and uses the right token, the message asks that they wait for the next token.

That way, when we add or remove, we edit the related vector. If we look up a name and the resulting vec has multiple entries, just take the first one, since it means the certificate is still valid."

__label__bug "Customer.email not added before used in squashed migration I've run into this while migrating from 0.8.0 to 1.0.0. It seems that the email field was added in https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/commit/9f374b7b0c324d1f7844ae885191b6afeb97e57a but not added in the migrations before it attempts to use them. So, running migrations, I end up with this error when it attempts to resync customers within the migration process:    `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such column: djstripe_customer.email`    When it's run on a fresh install it works since it doesn't seem to call the data until it's done, and it runs migrations that were left out of the squished one, which do add the missing fields:    ```  Applying djstripe.0001_squashed_0007_for_custom_subscriber_model...

It also allows you to target specific browsers so that Babel can do less work and you can ship native ES2015+ to user 😎 ! We are also in the process of releasing v7, so please give http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0 a read and help test it out in beta! Thanks so much for using Babel 🙏, please give us a follow on Twitter @babeljs for news on Babel, join slack.babeljs.io for discussion/development and help support the project at opencollective.com/babel  ```    So, we'll replace the former package, with the suggested [babel-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-env) update."

Could it be possible, that the app does not recognise the charger if the phone battery is on 100%?

For example: `keypath.has(obj, 'propertyA')` returns false, even if propertyA is a legit property of obj. This happens because obj is an array who has a property `propertyA` added to it after instantiation.    This bug doesn't affect `get` method. For this reason, and seeing `get` method logic, I propose  within this bugfixing, a refactoring of both `has` and `get` methods, maybe re-using logic from one function to the other."

__label__bug "AccessViolationException from BreakIterator We are getting an intermittent AccessViolationException when using BreakIterator in a concurrent test. This issue has been a particular thorn because on .NET Core it causes the NUnit test runner to fatally crash.     The exception only happens in the case where:    1. There is an open FileStream being used to read a file.  2. The scenario is being run as an NUnit test, xunit seems to work fine and so does a console application.  3. There is more than one thread calling `BreakIterator.GetWordBoundaries` or `BreakIterator.GetBoundaries` at the same time.  4. Some particular strings are being used when calling `BreakIterator`.

Clone the repository from https://github.com/NightOwl888/IcuAVE  2. Open in Visual Studio and build the solution  3. Under Visual Studio's Test Explorer right click the `IcuAVE.NUnit.TestAccessViolationException` test and choose ""Run Selected Tests""  4. Navigate to the Output pane and choose ""Tests"" from the ""Show output from"" dropdown, and check for the stack trace of the `AccessViolationException`  5. If the error didn't happen the first time, try again - it doesn't occur 100% of the time the test is run.     > **NOTE:** The test never actually fails in .NET Framework, but this exception causes a fatal crash of the NUnit test runner when running under .NET Core (when merging updates from #37).    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1538288/31863928-1e013e46-b77f-11e7-94b7-5576be59bc9d.png)  "

Example:  ```  root@server /home/myuser/jail/data # restic --repo /home/myuser/jail/data/ find ""*.jpg""  password is correct  Found matching entries in snapshot xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  /Wohnung/neu1.jpg  /Wohnung/neu2.jpg  /Wohnung/neu3.jpg  /Wohnung/neu4.jpg  /Wohnung/neu5.jpg  /Wohnung/neu6.jpg  ```      ## Actual behavior  got errors, see above.    ## Steps to reproduce the behavior  - create SFTP backend with pubkey authentication  - ""install"" restic on windows (=download the windows binary)  - download plink from the PuTTY project  - initialize a repo with the SFTP backend  - backup some snapshots  - try to find files    ## Do you have any idea what may have caused this?  Looks like it is something with the special plink-ish SFTP connection, because the find on the local dir on the remote server works.    ## Do you have an idea how to solve the issue?  No, i have no idea which permission to what could be denied.    ## Did restic help you or made you happy in any way?  Yes, a lot :)"

__label__bug "audit use of %% prefix operator in standard library e.g. https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/blob/5e6fc94b7f43dda028de779a874f12591fa0a50d/std/build.zig#L89    The `%%` prefix operator is supposed to mean that something is impossible, not that it's an error to happen. The above link is possible at runtime if the user passes in long `build_root` and `cache_root` parameters, and then the allocator runs out of memory while concatenating them. That's not impossible; that's an error.    I'm generally uneasy about `%%foo()` being easier to type than `%return foo()`. It seems that `%return foo()` should be more commonly used than `%%foo()`, so why is it harder to type? If the author isn't certain whether an error is possible or not, then use `%return` (or do more research and become certain). Only when the author is certain *despite the Zig type system* that an error is not possible is it appropriate to use the `%%` prefix operator.    Should we remove `%%foo()` and just let the user type `foo() %% unreachable` instead?"

One of these nodes is receiving input constantly, while the other does not. This results in nothing happening in the network, except the CheckTX function being broadcasted to the other node.     **What you expected to happen**:  I expected the input to be broadcasted to the other node, after which a block would be formed.    **How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  See above.    **Anything else do we need to know**:  I'm not entirely sure if this is even a bug, it could just be expected behavior that I will need to deal with.

Some omit the `& COMMSK`. There are a couple instances of this expression: `tp->tre.tretyp != TLST`.    I'm opening this issue semi-rhetorically. It is obvious that the `==` should be `!=`. The only question is whether the value being tested should be masked with `& COMMSK`. And, for that matter, whether every other instance of an equality or inequality test of that form should be masking the value before doing the comparison."

__label__bug "Scope and Chapter admin pages return errors The scope and chapter admin pages are both returning 500 errors, likely because of changes to ActiveAdmin introduced in the last Gemfile upgrade.    The custom serializers from `arcdata_core` override `has_attribute?` on these models, and require the argument provided to that method to respond to `to_sym`. ActiveAdmin calls `has_attribute?` to check column types in the version we're using, but since it's calling it with a Proc (for actions) it fails on these admin pages.    The easiest way to fix this since the serializers have custom logic is to monkey patch the method in ActiveAdmin that calls `has_attribute?` and check that the argument it's receiving isn't a descendant of `Core::SerializedColumns` which has this behavior. About to submit a PR implementing this"

I found out the issue was caused by a project config option I am using - namely     `<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>`    When this is enabled `dotnet publish` puts ALL the nuget dependencies AND their dependencies into the release folder.    For reference the release folder with the option:    <img width=""1169"" alt=""sshot-2"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750226/33858790-bd0d5be4-de96-11e7-98b1-dec2e1da9530.png"">    and without:    <img width=""1259"" alt=""sshot-3"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750226/33858798-c24477c8-de96-11e7-9018-6e671f1a4feb.png"">    something `dotnet` is doing fails when using this option.  So the fix is to not use the option.    Personally I use it because when debugging I need all the packages from nuget in the build directory - which is a temporary workaround until better assembly scanning systems are in place in `structuremap`"

This is a breaking issue and it basically means we are not allowed to do actions in quick succession inside the update function.     The following code fixes the error on our side but it is not ideal and the Suas store should handle the action queue internally:     ```    override fun update(state: CurrentRoutingState) {          if (state.routingState is RoutingState.RouteToInbox) {              TaskFormActivity.start(this, (state.routingState as RoutingState.RouteToInbox).id)              Handler().postDelayed({ store.dispatch(DetailLoaded) }, 50)          }      }  ```    Expected behaviour :     No exception. The following code inside the SuasStore's dispatch() method should work better and perhaps add new actions to a queue `notifyListener(oldState, getState(), result.getUpdatedKeys()); isReducing.set(false);`     This is a breaking issue and we cannot continue using the library with this issue still in.

__label__bug "google_compute_target_https_proxy with string name ssl_certificate doesn't stick _This issue was originally opened by @mickeyreiss as hashicorp/terraform#6012. It was migrated here as part of the [provider split](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/). The original body of the issue is below._    <hr>    I have a `google_compute_target_https_proxy` with an SSL certificate that I've uploaded manually to Google Cloud Console. It looks something like this:  ``` resource ""google_compute_target_https_proxy"" ""my-target-https-proxy"" {                                 name = ""my-lb-target""                                                                                url_map = ""${google_compute_url_map.my-target-url-map.self_link}""                                    ssl_certificates = [""projects/my-${var.my_environment_name}/global/sslCertificates/app-myapp-com""]  }                                                                                                           ```  When I plan and apply this resource, my target https proxy is created exactly as I'd expect. There's a proxy with the SSL cert that I had previously uploaded. Yay.  However, when I run `terraform plan`, it shows that the this resource is dirty and needs to be recreated:  ``` ~ google_compute_target_https_proxy.my-target-https-proxy     ssl_certificates.#: ""0"" => ""1""     ssl_certificates.0: """" => ""projects/my-staging/global/sslCertificates/app-myapp-com"" ```  This is very odd, as the target https proxy is still configured perfectly accordingly to my google cloud console. I'm not sure why terraform is refreshing my state incorrectly here. Is this a bug?  Thanks for the input! "

__label__bug "High memory usage on server after ~12 hours ## Description    After ~ 12 hours with a pycraft account connected to a server (1.12.1), memory usage on server is way more higher than official client or Minecraft Console Client (more than 2×): on my Ubuntu server with 16GB RAM, using htop, official client consumes 2.2%, MCC (Minecraft Console Client) consumes 3.0% and Pycraft consumes 7.1%. This seems to happen too with 1.11.2 server.    I'm using the latest version `46e058d`, zip-downloaded from GitHub. But I was able to reproduce with an older version, before 1.12.    ## Steps to reproduce    1. On a server, create a specific folder for Minecraft Server.  2. Download official server jar from Mojang: https://minecraft.net/fr-fr/download/server  3. Start a first time the server to generate eula.txt file.  4. Accept EULA.  5. Start again server, then run commands ""difficulty 0"" and ""gamerule doMobSpawning false"" to prevent mob generation (and random ram consumption).  6. Stop server.  7. (Optionnal) in server.properties, set online-mode to false to make tests easier.  8. Copy Minecraft Server folder twice: one for Pycraft client, one for MCC, one for official as reference.  9. In each directory, set a different listening port, and rename jar to readable name (for example, ""minecraft_server.1.12.1_pycraft.jar"")  10. Start each server  11. Connect at the same time one pycraft client, one MCC and one official client to its corresponding server.  12. Wait ~12 hours  13. Using any system tool, check memory usage for server: pycraft should use way more RAM than the others.    ## Expected results    Pycraft server should use almost the same quantity of ram than the other clients."

__label__bug "Should json-spirit be a required dependancy? ### Issue and Steps to Reproduce    The issue is that json-spirit is not considered a required dependency, but cmake build of the project fails if json-spirit cannot be found.    The issue can be reproduced by running `docker build .` on the following Dockerfile:    ```  FROM debian:sid    ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential    RUN apt-get install -y cmake  RUN apt-get install -y python python-dev  RUN apt-get install -y libssl-dev  RUN apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev  RUN apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler python-protobuf libprotobuf-dev  RUN apt-get install -y python-sphinx  RUN apt-get install -y libcrypto++-dev libcrypto++  RUN apt-get install -y liblua5.1-0-dev  RUN apt-get install -y libgtest-dev  RUN apt-get install -y git vim wget    RUN git clone https://github.com/mickem/nscp.git    WORKDIR nscp    RUN git checkout 0.5.2.22    #RUN git submodule update --init ext/cryptopp  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/gtest  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/json-spirit  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/md-protobuf  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/tinyxml2  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/google-breakpad  RUN git submodule update --init ext/json-protobuf  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/lua-protobuf  RUN git submodule update --init ext/miniz     #RUN chmod u+x /nscp/ext/md-protobuf/protoc-gen-md    WORKDIR /nscp/build    RUN cmake ../    RUN make  ```    ### Expected Behaviour    I would expect either that the build should complete without json-spirit (possibly with some missing functionality) or that the message displayed during the ""Validating required dependencies"" step should report that not all required dependencies have been found.    ### Actual Behaviour    If cmake is unable to find json-spirit, it displays a message to say     ```  -- Found dependencies:  ...  --  ! Json Spirit not found: JSON_SPRIT_DIR=  ...  -- Validating required dependencies:  --  - All required dependecies[sic] found!

On the other hand we're not relying on the data being ordered by date to render it on the client we could just change the test to not be order dependent and leave the query alone.    So we should check if wherever we use torque tiles we're assuming date order, or if the order doesn't affect our rendering.  "

This can't be good for connection stability.    I already created https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/issues/363 (because the device in question is an OPNsense box), but I suspect the problem lies on the ZT side."

The command is run as `dotnet` which loads the file from `$PATH`  3. The command is run from `$HOME`, not any other directory    ## Steps to reproduce  1. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  2. Install dotnet-sdk-2.1.3 using apt-get (https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linuxubuntu)  3. `mkdir ~/dotnet`  4. `cd ~/dotnet`  5. `wget https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/2.2.0-preview1-007840/dotnet-sdk-2.2.0-preview1-007840-linux-x64.tar.gz`  6. `tar -zxvf dotnet-sdk-2.2.0-preview1-007840-linux-x64.tar.gz`  7. `cd ~`  8. `nano .profile`  A. Add “$HOME/dotnet” to front of path  9. `source .profile`  10. `which dotnet`  A. Verify the path is `/home/username/dotnet/dotnet`  11. `dotnet -?`  A. Expected: Shows help  B. Actual: `Did you mean to run dotnet SDK commands? Please install dotnet SDK from: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409`  12. `~/dotnet/dotnet -?`  A. Works fine  13. `mkdir foo`  14. `cd foo`  15. `dotnet -?`  A. Works fine  16. `mv ~/dotnet ~/dotnet-foo`  17. `nano .profile`  A. Change `$HOME/dotnet` to `$HOME/dotnet-foo`  18. `source .profile`  19. `which dotnet`  A. Verify the path is `/home/username/dotnet-foo/dotnet`  20. `dotnet -?`  A.

__label__bug "Lazily creating publish connection causes some weird behavior As brought up in [Discourse](https://discuss.particular.net/t/rabbitmq-transport-brokerunreachableexception/272), the behavior around opening the publish connection means that we don't try to open the connection until the first send attempt, which overall seems like a decent optimization. If an endpoint doesn't need to send messages, then we don't open up an unused connection.    However, this does have a couple drawbacks:    - For a send-only endpoint, that means we start the endpoint without actually opening a connection to the broker at all. Any problem with the connection string or connectivity to the broker won't be discovered until the first attempt to send a message.  - [We initialize the connection lazily using `Lazy<T>`](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.RabbitMQ/blob/develop/src/NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ/Connection/ChannelProvider.cs#L11), so if the single attempt to open the connection throws an exception, that exception is cached and we can never open a publish connection for the lifetime of the endpoint.

__label__enhancement "Give the lobby creator extra powers Hey, I wrote about this in the voice chat thread but I think it deserves it's own topic. I really think it would be a good idea to give the lobby creator more powers to moderate their own rooms. At the moment if someone leaves a game half way through you have no option but to remake the game. You also can't remove people who you don't wish to play with but haven't necessary broken any rules.     Currently, this makes it very difficult to set up a mic only game. If I start a lobby and advertise it as mic only, if someone joins without a mic then I cannot remove them. The only way around this is to start a private game and spam discord links in chat and hope that enough people join the discord to get the password.     It would be so much better if the lobby creator could remove people from seats and could control when the game starts. This would allow them to kick AFKers and just restart the game and wait for 1 extra player to join and fill in, rather than remaking the entire game (this feature would also allow you to play a rematch with the same players without having to leave the lobby and create a new one).  Additionally this would help to combat trolls as the lobby creator could easily remove people without the need for site wide mods to always be there.     As well as this it would make it easier to set up a mic only game since you could wait for people to join discord and if they didn't you could remove them from the seats and only start the game when everyone has confirmed they have a mic.

__label__enhancement "Server-side screenshot rendering for PDF and image timetable export  We've had issues trying to get client side timetable export working consistently. Here's a proposal to switch to server side rendering like v2     ### Client side     - When the user requests for an export, we serialize the relevant Redux store (the current timetable config, theme color map, hidden modules, dark mode, timetable orientation) and send it to the server     ### Server side     - Install [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer), which runs a Headless Chrome instance (API reference - https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md)   - Create a second Webpack entry point that consists of only `<TimetableContainer>`   - Create a small Express server that listens to incoming requests   - Deserialize the state from incoming requests, push it into the Redux store   - Take screenshot and send it back to the client     This is surprisingly simple, and should be very robust because we're using the same rendering engine as the client. This will also allow us to support more features like     - PDF export   - Multiple sizes   - Include module table in the export     The only difference I can foresee is that font may be different because currently we use the OS default font, which obviously the server cannot support, but this is a small issue.

Is it a ""closest"" timestamp, the next thumbnail, or what?  The downside with displaying simply the next thumbnail would be short videos having their thumbnails be almost useless. Maybe move generate timestamps up by half an interval and choose the closest thumbnail?    ----    This is here to allow others to chime in. What are your thoughts?"

__label__enhancement "ChannelAbilityPreset uses some questionable order strings Since it uses OrderStringFactory without any specific requirements, it ends up with harmful orders. You should NEVER give ""AIMove"" to a channel ability, because it will trigger if AI is ordered to move. I just had a situation in my map where my worker was attacked and he immediately started casting the channel-based ability with the order string ""AIMove"" because he's forced to flee.    I think ChannelAbilityPreset should give order ids that you can actually give to the unit at least somewhat safely, the AIMove order is always going to be used because it's close to the start of the order list. So my suggestion is to hand pick the order strings to reduce the chance of this happening, as well as giving an optional argument to ChannelAbilityPreset's constructor (well, giving the user a new constructor) where they can input their own order string. I know  you can still do it by setting it otherwise, this would just be a handier way to do it.    OrderStringFactory should probably be reworked to at least push harmful orders to the bottom, and I think it should also have a blacklist that you can set if you know you're using specific orders. Like, I would blacklist the orders of abilities I know I am using alongside channel based abilities.    EDIT: I just figured out AIMove was getting triggered by something else. However it's still true that there should be a filter for what values the factory can generate."

__label__enhancement "Known ordering for RollupCalculateJob records Hey there, I'm a huge fan of the tool and recommend it to anyone that needs rollups (virtually everyone).    I think there might be a feature missing to ensure there is a known order of records when using the ""Calculate"" or ""Schedule Calculate"" feature. It appears that `RollupCalculateJob` is getting the query locator from `RollupService.masterRecordsAsQueryLocator`, though I do not see where this is implementing an `ORDER BY` clause.    If the user were to start a calculation for a rollup, it does not seem that the user should need to wait until that calculation finishes to begin the next rollup (provided the same parent object exists).    If the query returned from `RollupService.masterRecordsAsQueryLocator` were to use an `ORDER BY` clause as part of the query string, the order would be predictable, and thus the rollups could be staggered to start by a few minutes.    1. Is the statement above correct (re: predictable order)?  1. If so, would you like me to submit a PR with the proposed changes?

This causes excessive noise in the log file as there are potentially hundreds of overwrite warnings in a normal build.

__label__enhancement "All states and pillars are copied in TMPDIR Hello,    When kitchen-salt converges, there is a step of files transfers to copy them to /tmp/kitchen inside the VM.  But it seems that it's done in two steps:    - first: copy all sources to TMPDIR (/tmp by default)  - second: make them available inside the VM (sometimes it's a copy but it can be just mounting the temp dir with data inside the VM)    In our case, we use kitchen to test a full repository of salt states/pillars and files, which is several hundreds of MB. This double copy slows down our testing.    I wonder if the data directory could be directly shared/copied inside the VM, without this extra step.    I'm not sure this comes from kitchen-salt or test-kitchen.  "

__label__enhancement "Support per-Period PlaybackParams ### Issue description  I'm working on an app that plays a list of MP3 sequentially, applying different pitch/shift params to each. I use DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource. Every time I get a onPositionDiscontinuity, I verify that the media has effectively changed, and call setPlaybackParams with the parameters corresponding to that song.    However, right now it takes a while (200-300ms) for the playback params change to hit ExoPlayer's thread (that will eventually .flush() the audio processors), and this is very noticeable to the user, causing a bad experience.    It sounds like in order to get this right, ExoPlayer would need to keep track of the params for each source in the concatenating-source, and apply them to each Window/Period a bit more gracefully.    Do you have any ideas on how to approach a fix for this on app code, or do you think it's something that could be improved on ExoPlayer's side?    ### Reproduction steps  1) Seek to almost the end of a song  2) Let it auto play to the next song, configured with a different pair of pitch/shift  3) Listen to the audio of the 2nd song modified by the old params for a while, then switching to the new params    ### Link to test content  This can be reproduced with the media on the ExoPlayer sample app (playlist of Cats -> Dogs), using the mechanism described above.    ### Version of ExoPlayer being used  ExoPlayer r2.5.1    ### Device(s) and version(s) of Android being used  Reproduced on a Samsung S8 and Pixel C.

__label__enhancement "Support per-Period PlaybackParams ### Issue description  I'm working on an app that plays a list of MP3 sequentially, applying different pitch/shift params to each. I use DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource. Every time I get a onPositionDiscontinuity, I verify that the media has effectively changed, and call setPlaybackParams with the parameters corresponding to that song.    However, right now it takes a while (200-300ms) for the playback params change to hit ExoPlayer's thread (that will eventually .flush() the audio processors), and this is very noticeable to the user, causing a bad experience.    It sounds like in order to get this right, ExoPlayer would need to keep track of the params for each source in the concatenating-source, and apply them to each Window/Period a bit more gracefully.    Do you have any ideas on how to approach a fix for this on app code, or do you think it's something that could be improved on ExoPlayer's side?    ### Reproduction steps  1) Seek to almost the end of a song  2) Let it auto play to the next song, configured with a different pair of pitch/shift  3) Listen to the audio of the 2nd song modified by the old params for a while, then switching to the new params    ### Link to test content  This can be reproduced with the media on the ExoPlayer sample app (playlist of Cats -> Dogs), using the mechanism described above.    ### Version of ExoPlayer being used  ExoPlayer r2.5.1    ### Device(s) and version(s) of Android being used  Reproduced on a Samsung S8 and Pixel C.

Then just a black screen. Had to force shut down. Happened on windows 8.1. I know this information isn't particularly helpful, but try to decompile a fairly large 32-bit executable and watch the ram usage. I may be the only one who got a black screen, but can't be the only one with RAM usage sky rocketing to unreasonable levels.    As a side note, congratulations on the project. Even though I couldn't use this yet, I read https://retdec.com/web/files/publications/retdec-slides-botconf-2017.pdf and thought it's awesome. This program seems to decompile with the same quality or even better than hex-rays, and that's really something considering that all other decompilers I've tested so far besides hex-rays sucked. This decompiler seems very powerful. I guess I was just unlucky, but hopefully I'll be able to use it soon. Congratulations."

__label__enhancement "Validation ## Goal  Make it easier to extend the syntax and make compiler easier to work with.    ## Overview  This should unblock #28     Currently, the individual node parsing methods perform in-place validation on the syntax. For example, the identifier parser may throw an undefined variable syntax error if it cannot identify the variable.    https://github.com/ballercat/walt/blob/296f1cb1d19188c29e63ea96b6873df94781ba20/src/parser/maybe-identifier.js#L48    This is OK, but the more syntax is extended the harder it is to extend the behavior. In the above code, the undefined variable handler is overwritten to silence the error while parsing function arguments(while parsing the parent node). Instead of doing the above, let's have another step before the generator, a static type/validator checker.    The final pipeline will look like this:    `Tokenizer -> tokens -> Parser -> ast -> Static Checker -> ast/dag -> Generator -> ir -> Emitter -> bytecode`    Initial implementation would only handle `Identifier` nodes. This means the static checker would do the following:    - [ ] Ensure the identifier is valid/in-scope  - [x] Patch nodes to attach correct metadata, like global/local indexes, type definitions, function indexes and table pointers  - [ ] throw syntax errors if the identifier is undefined and only do so in correct context. For example, it should be fine for an identifier to be undefined in a function definition because that is the first node it's defined in.  - [x] Code generation needs to be moved entirely to its own step. Currently, functions generate IR in-place but this will need to change.    <!-- REMOVE THE COMMENTED OUT SECTION WHICH APPLIES TO YOUR ISSUE -->  <!-- Bug Reports  # Bug Report  ## Overview  One two sentence of the problem, if possible.    ## Expected  What _should_ happen    ## Actual  What _did_ happen    ## Example  For best results the shortest possible code snippet or spec.    -->    <!-- Feature Request  # Feature Request  ## Overview  Elevator pitch.  # Impact  Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large.

Specifically, we should implement an ""alpha decomposition"" which looks like this:    ![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 4 00 55 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19851673/28985007-8bd7ddba-792e-11e7-986c-40119127f20d.png)    To be more precise, given a factor risk model, we would like to see how much of the alpha's returns is explained by common risk factors, such as sector, momentum, etc. This is easily done by finding the algo returns' betas to the common factors through a simple multivariate linear regression. This would allow us to see how much of the alpha's returns is driven by genuine stock-specific reasons, and how much can be attributed to common factors."

__label__enhancement "Custom routes Currently the package catches every route and tries to get the appropriate `*.md` file for it. That makes it quite difficut to add custom routes with custom functionality.    Instead it would be better, if we could add the mozhi route handler at any place of the project using a simple call of a function. Something like `Mozhi::routes()`    Using this we could for example realize that Mozhi does only get initialized withing a route group    ```php  Route::prefix('cms')->group(function () {    Mozhi::routes();  });  ```    Using this way would also make it possible to add custom routes:    ```php  Route::get('/custom-stuff', function() {    echo 'This is a custom route';  });    Mozhi::routes();  ```"

__label__enhancement "swarm needs a gateway mode (transparent proxy that rewrites bzz:// URLs) Context:   You can run swarm on a local node and see swarm content on http://localhost:8500 or you could access swarm via a gateway. These require different HTML content than if you have a bzz:// URL handler installed in your browser.    Problem:  Swarm is meant to serve HTTP content for web3 dapps and serverless websites such as our swarm homepage `theswarm.eth`. In the HTML of that website we want to have URLs of the form  ```  bzz://theswarm.eth/images/some-image.png  ```  but at the moment we are using the *relative URL*  ```  bzz:/theswarm.eth/some-image.png  ```  which loads  ```  http://localhost:8500/bzz:/theswarm.eth/images/some-image.png  or  http://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/images/some-image.png  ```    This is not good. We cannot have the _content_ of swarm hosted websites to have to be adapted in this way. We need the following:      1. Default behaviour of all swarm hosted websites should be to use `bzz://` URLs.    2a. It should be possibly to run swarm with a `--gateway` flag which adds a transparent proxy to all swarm content, replacing `bzz://` with `http://localhost:8500/bzz:/` or with `http://gateway-url/bzz:/`.    2b. Swarm should not come with a gateway mode itself, but come bundled with an nginx config file that achieves the same as 2a. We should then describe this method in documentation and here: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8187/how-to-run-a-swarm-gateway      ----  Some notes:  An alternative is to do the re-writing client side, but then you cannot surf swarm content without a browser plugin / bzz:// handler     "

I should be able to specify a specific service account and not include any scopes.    ### Actual Behavior  ""scopes"" is a _required_ param- this is wrong. Using scopes like this is deprecated as well. If you specify a service account access is granted based on roles associated with that specific account. If you _don't_ specify a service account your using the default GCE account and then can grant specific access via scopes. Because scopes is required it means if I specify a service account I still have to specify specific scopes which defeats the purpose of a service account! In fact the GCP console doesn't even let you specify scopes if you specify a service account when creating a new instance.    ### Suggestion  Perhaps you should have an option to just allow ALL scopes. This seems to be what happens when you create an instance through the console with a specific account. ""Cloud API access scopes"" is set to ""Allow full access to all Cloud APIs"".

__label__enhancement "Sanity Checks of the Database All data in CWS is stored encrypted, and to verify that the data is still valid, a checksum is generated on the encrypted data and stored in the database. Upon reading out the encrypted data, the checksum is verified and if it fails, an error is returned.    Since the check is only made upon reading it, it can be that over time an Object has become corrupted and is no longer valid. For that reason, it will be helpful to add a Sanity check of the data, which can be either run at startup and/or at regular intervals. The check is running as a background job, and cannot be invoked via the API (it is controlled via the settings).    Two new setting keys will be added:    `# If the Sanity check should be performed at startup or not, default is true.`  `cws.sanity.check.startup = true`    `# The interval between sanity checks, meassured in days.`  `cws.sanity.check.interval = 180`    The result will be stored in a field next to the encrypted data, which will contain the the check result and timestamp of the last check. If it fails, then no more checks will be made, if it is successful, then it will be check at next startup    To also get a report, a new request will be added to the system interface, which can only be invoked by the System Administrator. The result of the request will be report of failed Objects and when they failed.    Note, the initial version of the sanity check is for standalone installations, i.e. systems where only a single instance of CWS is running. it is planned to extend this feature with domain support, to avoid that each CWS instance is performing sanity checks, when running multiple instances.    Extend the Sanity Check with a check for removal of other things which expire."

Here the point i am confused about:     As i understand the RSI calculation current it should sum all candle wins and candle losses (on close value in case of zenbot).   And then does its magic calculation (not important here).  If i am looking at the following code              s.lookback.slice(0, length).forEach(function (period) {            if (last_close) {              if (period.close > last_close) {                gain_sum += period.close - last_close              }              else {                loss_sum += last_close - period.close              }            }            last_close = period.close          })      Lets assume that we have RSI_Length of 3 and 4 Lookback data of [6 (youngest) , 7 , 5, 4 (oldest, but not in RSI_Length)]  It will start with the youngest lookback and will use the following numbers (6 -> 7 -> 5) for calculation.  So the calculation will be the following, if i am understanding it right:  1. iteration last_close = NULL --> use 6  2. iteration 7 > 6 so gain_sum = 1  3. iteration 5 < 7 so loss_sum = 2    On my option the calculation has to be reversed, because actually moving from  lookback[2] to lookback[1] is a gain and not a loss!  Right values should be:  gain_sum =  2  (candle 5 --> 7)   loss_sum = 1 (candle 7 --> 6)    So i think there is an reverse() missing before iteration?

__label__enhancement "IsItemHovered(), IsWindowHovered() improvements (This is a news/info post. Will close in a few days)    I have pushed a bunch of changes related to the IsItemHovered() and IsWindowHovered() functions, in the form of new flags.     This is interesting to know:  - If you are using mouse-triggered popups (~context menus) this is also interesting.  - If you are using Drag'n Drop related idioms (#143) in your code this will likely interest you, and might affect you.  - If you are using any other idioms related to hovering, most commonly when creating tooltip or displaying status based on hovered items.    Previously it was frequent to use `IsItemRectHovered`/`IsItemHoveredRect` (same function, was renamed on August 22) to do a basic rectangle-only test.    The existing normal functions now have flags to allow this and more, with better defined options:  ```  bool IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags flags = 0);  bool IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags flags = 0);  ```    The flags are:  ```  enum ImGuiHoveredFlags_  {      ImGuiHoveredFlags_Default                       = 0,        // Return true if directly over the item/window, not obstructed by another window, not obstructed by an active popup or modal blocking inputs under them.      ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup       = 1 << 0,   // Return true even if a popup window is normally blocking access to this item/window      //ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByModal     = 1 << 1,   // Return true even if a modal popup window is normally blocking access to this item/window. FIXME-TODO: Unavailable yet.      ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem  = 1 << 2,   // Return true even if an active item is blocking access to this item/window      ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped           = 1 << 3,   // Return true even if the position is overlapped by another window      ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly                      = ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped  };  ```    - This is particularly useful for contextual menu triggered from an item. The high-level `BeginPopupContextItem()` helper now uses the `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup` flag meaning that you can right-click again on a different spot to reopen a context menu. (#439). Note that I also have committed another change that allows closing popups by right-clicking anywhere, making popups generally more usable.    - Those new options will make it easier/clearer to have finer controls on drag and drop related behaviour.  - If you use e.g. tooltip you can also have finer controls as to how when they should appear.    In the demo window you can visualize the output of those functions will different flags:    ![hovered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31837945-ff7f9800-b5da-11e7-9ea7-e023aebb0d25.png)  Above: normal hovering.    ![hovered_allow_when_overlapped](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31837968-1570c40e-b5db-11e7-9366-bea5b7faeec5.png)  Above: Here the button is hidden by another window, but `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped)`/`RectOnly` call returns true as expected:    ![hovered_allow_when_blocked_by_popup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31838003-36b2b65e-b5db-11e7-826b-01897f633d63.png)  Above: Here there is an open popup (the color picker) which prevents from clicking the button ""ITEM"" (so it doesn't appear as hovered). The `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup)` and `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup)` calls both returns true.    ![hovered_allow_when_blocked_by_active](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31838060-71bf036a-b5db-11e7-8be0-bacfd43848a9.png)  Above: Here I have clicked on the DRAG ME button and click-dragged the mouse over the ITEM button. The `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem)` returns true.    Hope it is clear, and useful!  I haven't worked out in details how those features may relate to parent-child window relationship, and I imagine we could introduce new flags there.    BREAKING CHANGES  - `IsItemHoveredRect/IsItemRectHovered` has been obsoleted, it is equivalent to calling: `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly)` aka all the flags enabled. I have kept an inline function doing that.  - On August 22 I renamed `IsItemHoveredRect` to `IsItemRectHovered` for consistency with other functions. Instead of keeping 2 legacy names, I have now completely removed the name introduced on August 22, since few people will have renamed it their code, and if they did they are likely to find their way through the new changes. So only the oldest legacy name persist and it will be obsoleted in a few months/years.    - Similarly, `IsWindowRectHovered()` has been obsoleted, the exact behavior that it had is equivalent to calling `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem)`.  - Similarly, on August 22 I renamed `IsMouseHoveringWindow` to `IsWindowRectHovered` and I have removed the most recently introduced name. So the oldest legacy name `IsMouseHoveringWindow` will persist for a few more months/years.    - `IsWindowHovered()` default behavior has been changed to return false if an item of another window is active. It makes the function more consistent and symmetrical with `IsItemHovered()` and I believe it is a better default and won't affect many people. You can call `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem)` to get the old behavior.  This will probably affect you if you were doing drag and drop across windows and using `IsWindowHovered`.    "

__label__enhancement "Question: (MemTotal - Memory Used) vs. Memory Available. Referring to the previous Q&A in issue #1034 (""Help required to match data to of system.ram to free -m""):    Netdata provides system RAM metrics of Free, Used, Cached and Buffers.  Per closed issue #1034, Used is calculated as:    unsigned long long Used = MemTotal - MemFree - Cached - Buffers;    I have been using this ""Used"" metric as a percentage of MemTotal (calc'd through Netdata provided metrics as the sum of free, used, cached and buffers) to track how close the system is to being out of memory (OOM) when it approaches and hits 100% Used.    However, while (MemTotal - Used) does seem to be close to the OS provided metric of MemAvailable most of the time based on observation, they do report different results.    From the kernel commit comment at [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773), MemAvailable does a calculation that's a little more involved that what (MemTotal - Used) amounts to, and that calculation may change in the future.    For those of us who would like to track available system memory closely and accurately, wouldn't it be good to provide the OS calculated MemAvailable metric as well since that seems to differ by a least a small extent to the estimate of (MemTotal - Used)?    Or is there a better way to look at this than I am doing?  Or maybe I'm missing something?    Thanks!    John          "

__label__enhancement "Views for all typed arrays with alignment, member offset decorators. If I allocate an array like float32[1024] I should be able to map it to float32x4 and perform SIMD operations on it with no overhead.    I'm unsure of the syntax at the moment. Typed arrays already have view syntax with buffer.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays    ```js  TODO  ```    Someone I was talking to asked that I include a stride. So basically:    ```js  new uint32[](buffer [, byteOffset [, length [, stride]]]);  ```    The idea that you could create an array of the data types or an array of typed objects and map them to a binary store. So if you load some byte data from a memory mapped file you can immediately put a class mapping over it without doing any allocations. Another example would be creating a pool allocator and using stride to ensure alignment is preserved.        SIMD can benefit from alignment so a reserved decorator @align(n), @offset(n), @size(n) would be nice on a per member instance. align would ensure that allocations of a class are aligned to an address that's a multiple of the specific align amount. offset would offset a specific member by a number of bytes. size would set the size of a class. Not sure if decorators are ideal for this or if the language needs keywords.    ```js  @align(16)  @size(32) // Says the the class is 32 bytes. Pads with zeros when allocating  class Test  {      @offset(2)      x:float32; // aligned to 16 because of the class alignment and offset by 2 bytes      @align(4)      y:float32x4; // 2 (from the offset above) + 4 (for x) is 6 bytes and we said it has to be aligned to 4 bytes so 8 bytes offset from the front. Instead of @align(4) we could have put @offset(8)  }  ```    The align, offset, and size can be evaluated at evaluation. Might be nice to seal or freeze the class with special syntax. Ideally these are POD structs essentially.    Might edit this later. Needed to jot this down since it keeps coming up in discussions."

A few options include:   * using `tee` in the wrapper script  * setting `log_path` in `ansible.cfg` [[1]]  * setting an `ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH` environment variable in the wrapper    |  |  Pros | Cons |  |-| -----|------|  |`tee`| We can create files, directory ahead of time; we can use shell variables in the file path easily, can log based on tags passed  | It's another command to have to work with and worry  about mucking with exit codes; only works when the wrapper is used  |  |`log_path`| Works regardless of whether or not wrapper is used | More difficult to configure name dynamically (date, time, etc) |  |`ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH`| Benefits of `tee` plus we can allow users to set the environment variable themselves and not override if they've set it  | Only works when the wrapper is used |    We could use a combination of `log_path` and `ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH`. Since Ansible checks the environment first (see [2] after the list of links), we could set a log file in the wrapper `/opt/vm/logs/$TAG/$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S').log`. In the event that doesn't work, we can have `log_path` set to `/opt/vm/logs/last_run.log`, or a more-likely-to-exist directory `/var/logs/vm_ansible.log`. I really don't want to use `tee` unless there is a compelling reason to do so.    I would like to ship this in the spring VM so that we can get logs from users if (*when*) things go wrong; however, I will let someone else target this to a milestone. It doesn't seem like it'd be awful to implement, but deciding the right way to do it is the trickier part. A nice thing is that all of them are easily changeable since they'd all be set in files we control.

__label__enhancement "Easy way to calculate replication progress <!--      Hello! 👋      Thank you for opening an issue on PouchDB.      There is also a 3-Minute read, on how to format your issue:      https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/      This template is optional, but it may help us fix your issue faster. --> ### Issue  Replication progress feedback is required for users of large dbs. The best way I have found so far is to use `last_seq / update_seq`, as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29138091/pouchdb-couchdb-sequence-counter-on-replicate/29143448#29143448) by @nolanlawson .  However, recently I was bitten by this technique as `update_seq` is unique to each db and replicating to an empty db does not guarantee `update_seq` will match after replication has completed. This results in a progress value that never reaches 100%, and can break other logic that is waiting for that condition.  Try as I might, I cannot get an **ACCURATE** _Progress Value_ based on the data given by the  `.on('change', ...)` event.  The values don't seem to add up. I've tried countless combinations of these stats `docs_read, docs_written, last_seq, docs.length, remote.info(), update_seq`, but I can never arrive at a 100% complete value (with certainty for all cases).  Is there a better algorithm for calculating replication progress other than `last_seq / update_seq` ?   I'd prefer not to have to poll the /_active_tasks endpoint etc for progress too.  If a more robust algorithm is found, I would be happy to write a plugin. ### Info - Server: CouchDB 2.0   (with `pending` docs avail in _changes feed) "

The attributes is a space separated list of attribute syntax of one of the following:    * `name=value`  * `name='value'`  * `name=""value""`  * `#id`  * `.class`    AttributesNode which start with `#` such as `#id-string` are equivalent to `id=""id-string""` and  `.class-name` are equivalent to `class=""class-name""`    NOTE: class values are accumulated as a space separated list.

I suggest to create a new repo where we move all of these 3 packages to, in order to reduce the maintenance effort.    1. openni_launch  1. rgbd_launch  1. openni_camera    **Background**  Despite the inactive development, the release tasks for these packages still takes certain amount of work. For Lunar this time, I took charge of it and for total it took almost an hour,  mainly because these packages are inter-depended and I had to make release one by one and wait for the binary to become ready, in order for `bloom` to be able to resolve the necessary dependency.    **Suggested solution**  Create a new repo and move all of these 3 packages there.  Suggestion for the repo name appreciated. Here I temporarily use *`openni_meta`*.    New repo and the contents (being updated over time taking suggestions in):    ```  ros-drivers/openni_meta  |- freenect_camera  |- freenect_launch  |- openni_camera  |- openni_launch  |- openni_meta  |- rgbd_launch  ```    `openni_meta` is a meta package that run_depends on these 3 packages.

__label__enhancement "Monitor piwheels usage I'd like to monitor usage of piwheels, either by post-processing Apache logs, or ideally, adding an Apache hook so the logs get sent into a database. It would be really cool if we could catch every web request and log it onto the main piwheels database.    The Apache logs include entries like this:    ```  [31/Jul/2017:11:17:33 +0100] ""GET /numpy/numpy-1.13.1-cp34-cp34m-linux_armv7l.whl HTTP/1.1"" 200 8988260 ""-"" ""pip/1.5.6 CPython/3.4.2 Linux/4.4.48-v7+""  ```    Which indicates a `pip install numpy`. Note the user agent is `pip`.    It would be good to monitor stats on:    - Downloads (installs)  - Download attempts (can we see if a `pip install` attempts to browse for a package that we don't have)  - Regular web browser access to the homepage and package pages    If it was related to the piwheels database then we can run queries joining on the `packages` and `package_versions` tables.

(b) deeper profound issues where API was deprecated or changed significantly and we will need to investigate other ways to achieve the same functionality:  **Need to investigate and consider profound rewrite** - feel to open a GH issue with ideas on how to handle each one of those issues (separate issue for each) :  High priority - [ ] Create a v2 branch that changes target for Orleans to .NET Standard 1.6   - Ideally still use csproj as in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tutorials/target-dotnetcore-with-msbuild (this means that we'll have to update from .NET 4.5.1 in all dependent projects) - [ ] Remove usage of App Domains for scanning https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/919   - [ ] Revisit Assembly Loading (`LoadFrom` -> `AsemblyLoadContext`, Location,...) #2025 - [ ] Provide an alternative fallback serializer (BinaryFormatter is not supported in .NET Core). The biggest concern is serializing exceptions, as they are not typically part of the grain interfaces, and we don't generate Orleans serializers for all exceptions in the system. We have a few workarounds in prototype that need to be enhanced. - [ ] `PerformanceCounter` - not supported in .NET Core. - [ ] `Environment.UserName` - [ ] `CallContext.LogicalSetData` - potentially replace with `AsyncLocal<T>` - [ ] Update codegen to be more aggressive and generate serializers for Exception types - [ ] `SerializationInfo` - not supported in .NET Core.  2nd priority - [ ] Compile time codegen working with new dotnet cli tooling (although be aware that the tooling will drop support for `project.json` once it RTMs, and we are not sure if the build tools will work once they start using csproj once again)   - [ ] Avoid having OrleansCodeGenerator depend on Orleans project, since that creates a circular dependency to getting codegen to work easily (especially since Orleans.dll requires build time codegen). This is a nice to have, but not required if we solve the previous item in some other way. - [ ] Allow `TestCluster` to work without creating new AppDomains for each silo (for example, by leveraging containers, or spawning and managing new processes)  3rd priority - [ ] Separate test projects for each provider that brings in a new dependency (ideally even if that dependency is also supported in .NET Core, otherwise we would need to port the entire codebase before we can start testing each individual component we port) - [ ] CI servers run tests in many platforms - [x] `System.Runtime.Serialization.FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject` - [x] `System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle` -> `System.Diagnostics.Process.SafeHandle`  ---  **Already done issues (for progress tracking):** - [x] `Type.IsInterface`-> `Type.GetTypeInfo.IsInterface` (`IsClass`, `IsGenericType` , `IsAbstract`, `IsPrimitive`, `IsEnum`). - [x] `Type` -> `TypeInfo` for most members (in Orleans code, and code generated by OrleansCodeGenerator) #1783 #1894 #1997  - [x] `TextReader.Close` -> `TextReader.Dispose` #609 #2034 - [x] `Socket.Close` -> `Socket.Dispose` - [x] `Delegate.CreateDelegate` -> `MethodInfo.CreateDelegate` - [x] `ApplicationException(string)` - [x] `System.Data` and `System.Transactions` - used in SQL utils.

IMO 4 powder into a rod might be too powerful with the secondary outputs from pulverizing, meaning 5 could also be well balanced for TE. If you've ever thought about using the other rods for any recipes, I think it would be super handy to be able to make them this way.    ---    Completely separate suggestion, but following on from that idea, I'd also LOVE it if there could be blocks of the rods, so 9 rods into a block like a Blaze lantern. I think it would be great for decoration, maybe even have them emit light. Alternatively, I'd also suggest that you could even bring back the Glowstone Illuminator, with various TE fluids enabling different colours and the rods enabling different coloured frames! If you wanted to add some steps for balance or to increase the cost of entry, I'd suggest transposing Energised Glowstone into various solids (Enderium blend, Redstone, Blizz powder etc.) to generate glowing variants of items, to then put into rod frames to create the lantern. That's a whole completely different suggestion in-of-itself though, lmk if I should put it through as a separate thread if that's easier.    ---    Thanks for reading, and for all of your hard work, I couldn't bring myself to get into 1.12 until TE was all updated!"

The OBS Document Availability Updates monitors on a biannual basis one of the factors included in the Open Budget Index: whether governments are at least releasing the eight key budget documents to the public (it does not assess the level of detailed information provided).

For this to work, we'd need to reconsider the event processing from being a single linear sequence to being a set of multiple parallel sequences -- basically a tree of event processors.  I think this might be overkill/inappropriate for this purpose.    Instead, I propose to add to the EventProcessor a call which can be made to mark that the given event should or should not be kept.

I think that it could exist a dynamic dispatch when we call `wrapper.tryAdvance(..)`, because `tryAdvance()` is still virtual. If we make it `final` on `WrappingAdvancer` and because the `wrapper` field is resolved to this concrete type (instead of `Advancer`) then the `wrapper.tryAdvance(..)` call can be dispatched statically and avoid additional overhead."

__label__enhancement "Initial states aren't executed  If you have a statechart that defines an initial state, then when a machine ""starts"" it _enters_ the state.  This means that the _effects_ of that initial state should be able to get a hold of.    For a normal state transition, you pass in the current state, and an event, and you get back (among other things) the new state, and the side effects of any exits and entrys that happen.    However, when you are starting out, you haven't even entered that initial state.  There should be a way to get to that initial state, and any side effects.  Passing in 'undefined' as the current state might be a way, since there is no event, and no initial state. So perhaps `transition()` with no args should return that initial State instance."

__label__enhancement "Add Destroy or Update methods Dear author, Thank you for providing this plugin.  I recently use this plugin in my project while I encountered a problem. The content of my div can be changed, so I have to re-initialize the plugin.  For example, I wrote the following code  ``` javascript $('#content-view').resizable({     handleSelector: '.resize-grip',     onDrag: function(e, $el, newWidth, newHeight) {         if(newWidth < 100) return false;     } });  // After content is changed... $('#content-view').resizable({     handleSelector: '.resize-grip',     onDrag: function(e, $el, newWidth, newHeight) {         if(newWidth < 500) return false;     } }); ```  In this case, the new options fail to take effect (struggle with previous options). What's even worse, `Function startDragging()` will be fired twice.  Currently, I manually unbind the events with the following code before re-initialization, `$('#content-view .resize-grip').off('mousedown.rsz touchstart.rsz');` I think that would be great if the plugin can provide a destroy or a update methods for users.

It's also however a rather tricky subject to deal with, but I believe I have a solution that should work, and be fairly idiomatic using F# attributes.    If we introduce the following interface/abstract base attribute class:    ```fsharp  type IDecoratorAttribute =    abstract Target: obj    abstract Args: obj list  ```    Which can be used like this:    ```fsharp  module AngularBindings    // I don't know these functions, but you should get   let compDec = import ""Component"" ""angular""the point    [<AttributeUsage(AttributeTarget.Class)>]  type ComponentAttribute () =    let mutable selector: String option    // Don't know if this works, haven't used attributes in F# in forever    member x.Selector with set v = selector <- Some v      interface IDecoratorAttribute with      member x.Target = compDec      member x.Args =        [ ""selector"", selector ]        |> List.map (fun (k, v) -> Option.map (fun v -> k, v) v)        |> List.choose id        |> createObj    // later  [<Component(Selector = ""my-app"")>]  type Foo =    ...  ```    This could compile into something like this:    ```js  import toDecorator from 'fable-core/decorator';    @toDecorator(() => {    const attr = new ComponentAttribute();    attr.Selector = 'my-app';    return attr;  }())  class Foo {}  ```    It's not exactly pretty, but it would work, and enable support for a bunch of angular stuff, and some react stuff (like mobx) etc."
__label__enhancement "Enable DocumentDB server-side programming ## Enable DocumentDB server-side programming    This issue suggests adding Azure DocumentDB server side scripts as a Fable execution target. Since Azure functions support F# and there is good Functions-DocumentDB integration this will enable a ""full-stack"" F# programming experiance Fable SPA->Functions->DocumentDB hopefully passing F# records all the way.     Document DB is Azure's No-SQL database offering. It's native storage format is JSON and it's language for serverside scripting (stored procedures, triggers, post save actions userdefined functions) is JavaScript, specifically ECMA-262. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-programming.       ## Creating Stored Procedures in JavaScrip  Using a DocumentDB server-side script involves the following steps:  1. Writing a JavaScript function. The function must include in its body all code needed for the script, there is no way to reference external libraries or files.  2. Registering the function with a DocumentDB. One way of doing this is POSTing the JavaScript source to the Database.   3. Calling the function. For exmaple a stored procedure may be called by exeuting a POST request against its URI passing any parameters as a JSON Array of JSON object.    JavaScript scripts can be created, registred and called using a number of DocumentDB SDKs:  * [Node.js client with Q Promises](http://azure.github.io/azure-documentdb-node-q/)  * .Net SDKs  * Straight JavaScript  * REST API    The following is an example of how to register and execute a stored procedure using the REST API:    ```  POST https://dbs/testdb/colls/testColl/sprocs/sprocs/ HTTP/1.1  authorization: <<auth>>  x-ms-date: Thu, 07 Aug 2014 03:43:10 GMT      var x = {  ""name"": ""createAndAddProperty"",  ""body"": function (docToCreate, addedPropertyName, addedPropertyValue) {              var collectionManager = getContext().getCollection();              collectionManager.createDocument(                  collectionManager.getSelfLink(),                  docToCreate,                  function(err, docCreated) {                  if(err) throw new Error('Error:  ' + err.message);                  docCreated[addedPropertyName] = addedPropertyValue;                  getContext().getResponse().setBody(docCreated);                  });          }  }  ```  Notice the stored procedure is registered by executing a POST request against the URI dbs/testdb/colls/testColl/sprocs with the body containing the stored procedure to create. Triggers and UDFs can be registered similarly by issuing a POST against /triggers and /udfs respectively.     Once registered this stored procedure can then be executed by issuing a POST request against its resource link:  ```  POST https://<url>/sprocs/<sproc> HTTP/1.1  authorization: <<auth>>  x-ms-date: Thu, 07 Aug 2014 03:43:20 GMT      [ { ""name"": ""TestDocument"", ""book"": ""Autumn of the Patriarch""}, ""Price"", 200 ]  ```  Here, the input to the stored procedure is passed in the request body. Note that the input is passed as a JSON array of input parameters. The stored procedure takes the first input as a document that is a response body. The response we receive is as follows:  ```  HTTP/1.1 200 OK    {     name: 'TestDocument',    book: ‘Autumn of the Patriarch’,    id: ‘V7tQANV3rAkDAAAAAAAAAA==‘,    ts: 1407830727,    self: ‘dbs/V7tQAA==/colls/V7tQANV3rAk=/docs/V7tQANV3rAkDAAAAAAAAAA==/’,    etag: ‘6c006596-0000-0000-0000-53e9cac70000’,    attachments: ‘attachments/’,    Price: 200  }  ```    ## What needs to be done to enable this feature    ### F# ""shim types"" to support writing scripts  The DocumentDB scripting environment exposes a Context and a number of other types for doing things like setting response, reading parameters etc. Even the simple HelloWorld stored procedure below needs access to the Response type to set the response.    ```  POST https://dbs/testdb/colls/testColl/sprocs/sprocs/ HTTP/1.1  authorization: <<auth>>  x-ms-date: Thu, 07 Aug 2014 03:43:10 GMT    var x = {  ""name"": ""helloWorldStoredProc"",  ""body"": function () {          var context = getContext();          var response = context.getResponse();            response.setBody(""Hello, World"");          }  }  ```    These would be be something like:  ```  // shim types  type Request = {      content : string  }  type Response = {      body : string  } with      member this.setBody output =           this.body = output    type Context = {      request : Request      response : Response  } with       member this.getRequest =          this.request      member this.getResponse =          this.response    let getContext = {      request = {content = """"}      response = {body = """"}  }  ```  These types will let us write the stored procedure as:  ```  let helloWorldStoredProc =       let context = getContext      let response = context.getResponse      response.setBody ""Hello World""  ```  A full list of these types is [here]( http://azure.github.io/azure-documentdb-js-server/).     ### Post packaging  Because DocumentDB scripts can't reference any external libraries the JavaScrip Fable generates needst to be embedded into the function that will be registered with DocumentDB. Something like this:  ```  var helloWorldStoredProc = {      id: ""helloWorld"",      serverScript: function () {          <All the JS functions created to support f# features used          ...>            var context = getContext();          var response = context.getResponse();            response.setBody(""Hello, World"");      }  }  ```  This can then be posted to the desired URI to register the stored procedure.    ### Workflow  It is not clear what the best workflow for creating stored procedures will be.

IMO 4 powder into a rod might be too powerful with the secondary outputs from pulverizing, meaning 5 could also be well balanced for TE. If you've ever thought about using the other rods for any recipes, I think it would be super handy to be able to make them this way.    ---    Completely separate suggestion, but following on from that idea, I'd also LOVE it if there could be blocks of the rods, so 9 rods into a block like a Blaze lantern. I think it would be great for decoration, maybe even have them emit light. Alternatively, I'd also suggest that you could even bring back the Glowstone Illuminator, with various TE fluids enabling different colours and the rods enabling different coloured frames! If you wanted to add some steps for balance or to increase the cost of entry, I'd suggest transposing Energised Glowstone into various solids (Enderium blend, Redstone, Blizz powder etc.) to generate glowing variants of items, to then put into rod frames to create the lantern. That's a whole completely different suggestion in-of-itself though, lmk if I should put it through as a separate thread if that's easier.    ---    Thanks for reading, and for all of your hard work, I couldn't bring myself to get into 1.12 until TE was all updated!"

__label__enhancement "Ghost-Effect Material: Simply using Rim and Refraction to get an eerie invisible-glow effect. Also, suggestions for enhancing the Rim options. **Operating system or device - Godot version:**    Godot 3.0 Pre-Alpha Build, Windows 10    Lately I've been messing around with the Spatial material to try to create a invisible/phantom/glowing membrane like material and was able to make this:    ![godot_ghost_effect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5027750/27992575-b6509826-644c-11e7-8675-acbf477bc8c9.png)    Utilizing Rim to get the glowing edges and Refraction for the invisible distortion, this was the most impressive (or probably a not-bad, first time attempt) in recreating the effect. For Rim it turns out that despite the ""Tint"" adjustment goes up to 1 in maximum, there is no limit to how low the minimum is required. For example: adjust Tint to -100 and you have a blended glowing edge on your object!    Refraction is simple enough to utilize to get the invisble effect.    The idea and main point in this is that the Rim has the potential to be enhanced further so then it can be utilized in maybe creative ways. For example, ghosts or creepy, invisible membrane like object (Sorta like how Metroids have a near invisisble but glowing membrane)    What extras Rim should/could have:    - Make the Rim colorable, so then it does not use the same white glow,  - An adjustment bar or boolean for the rim glow to be ""emittable"", (Turns out you need a light source or directional light to get the glow, would be awesome if the rim was made emittable without a light source. Better if using an adjustment bar for animation or programming purposes.)  - Make an adjustment bar to adjust the width or visibility of the glowing rim so then typing -100 into the ""tint"" isn't used.  - And allow a boolean option whether different objects with rims appear behind the other invisble/rim objects (As you can see in the example image, the rims does not overlap or merge completely within another object.)    **Steps to reproduce:**    Add a new mesh to the scene, make a new material:    -Add a directional light to get the Rim glow.  -Adjust the Albedo's Alpha adjustment bar so then refraction can work,  -Set the Metallic to 0 and the Metallic Specular to 0 to avoid glassy reflections in refraction,  -Set Roughness to 0  -Enable Rim, set rim to ""1"", and type in the tint adjustment: ""-100"", trust me it works despite breaking limitations. (P.S. Unless there is an option to adjust the with of the rim, don't patch it.)  -Enable Refraction, set scale to 0.07. This allows distortion in invisibility  -(OPTIONAL): You can try to use Normalmapping to add details.    I can already imagine a lot of ghosts/spirits/souls flying around in a game project involving jumpscares, ghost hunting, or etc."

__label__enhancement "Spotters: Lifters that help other lifters when they fail (using Gymrat) This is a tracking issue for the effort to implement ""Spotters"" -- lifters that fix-up or implement missing features in other lifters.    The primary goal of this in the short term is to add hot-patches to libVEX using the gymrat framework, as we expect this to be 100000x easier than modding VEX itself.  For example, let's say we want to implement `svc` in ARM Cortex M; I don't expect the VEX folks to ever want to do that.  So we'll do it! But modding libVEX is complex, and I don't want to write a full gymrat lifter for ARM.  A Spotter here would be perfect.     Some scratch ideas:  - Lifters in pyvex are registered in ""order"", and tried in order, and if they fail, keep trying them  - rhelmot says we should be able to get partial blocks from VEX. This is the crucial trick.    Tasks:  1. Merge `feature/expanded_reality` into master so gymrat actually works  2. Mod the primary lifter mechanism so that partial block info is available to future lifters  3. Create a `Spotter` class (in lifter_helper.py) appropriate for these sorts of lifters.  4. Success criteria: We can do Cortex M4 hard FPU and maybe SVC, etc instructions this way.  "

Would you want to use existing libraries, or so I try to train a classifier from scratch?

I thought it should be possible to get around this by writing the SQL directly in the SQL Editor, however somewhere along the line the table name is being qualified (in my instance it''s got main.tablename, rather than just tablename) which sqlite does not allow for trigger creation.  E.g. the following will not work using the SQL Editor:  CREATE TRIGGER TestTrigger        AFTER UPDATE OF name ON TestTable BEGIN ..

__label__enhancement "Don't set max execution delay on JobScheduler when RequirementsEnforced is true Currently when you set RequirementsEnforced to true, the library still sets a max execution delay in JobScheduler when using  either JobScheduler or the Firebase JobScheduler.  It then checks that the requirements are meet, and reschedules with a back off period.  The client code still doesn't run, so the max window didn't do anything but cause the app to get woken up, so you can determine that it needs to wait longer.  This also seemed to cause a long delay before waking up when if the job had to be rescheduled many times.     Both of those JobSchedulers already have a way to make sure the job does not get started until the requirements are meet.  This library should instead add the requirements to the Job submitted to the JobSchedulers without a max delay, then the app is not woken up until the requirements are meet, and the delay between the job running and the requirements getting meet becomes very small.    I know this will not work for the alarm manager version.  This is where the waking up and checking for the conditions are required.    This will also keep the exponential back off to only apply to the job failing vs the requirements not getting meet.    If the user doesn't set RequirementsEnforced to true, then they want to get woken up if not able to complete, and then handle it some other way, and the current implementation makes sense.  "

__label__enhancement "Support for emitting the same state of an ECO button I just added an ECO button to my setup and I noticed that when it is ""open"" and I press ""auto"" (which will set the state to ""open"") this signal is not emitted again. This is due to the nature of pimatic ContactSensors (see pimatic/lib/devices.coffee line 511).    For me it would make sense that the ECO button emits it's state when pushed regardless of the previous state. Imagine you have two rules:  1) Press ""AUTO"" to set all thermostats to 20°  2) Press ""ECO"" to set all thermostats to 16°    This would work if you only use the button. But when you activated ECO mode and then changed the temperature of a thermostat by hand and just want to set all thermostats to ECO again this would not work as the button already is in ECO-state (""closed"") and will not emit the state again.    Is there any chance to change this behaviour? Perhaps this is also a request which has to be forwarded to pimatic itself."
__label__enhancement "Search and IncSearch use the same colour. At the moment Search and IncSearch highlight groups use the same colour. This can get a little confusing when you have `set hlsearch incsearch` and you are searching for fragments of a CamelCase word.    **How to recreate**    1. Start a new buffer and run the following commands:  ```viml  :colorscheme github  :set hlsearch incsearch  :normal ggiThisIsMyTest  ```  2. Search for `Test` and hit Enter  3. Search for `MyT` but do not hit Enter    Now my IncSearch highlight is merged with the previous Search highlight and it appears that highlighted string is ""MyTest""?    **My solution**    ... is to use a slightly different colour for IncSearch, eg:    ```viml  hi IncSearch guibg=#ffb4e3 ctermbg=217  ```  This doesn't match any of the ""official"" github colours, but `incsearch` is a feature not available on github, so I think it should be ok to use a different colour.

__label__question "Animating backgroundColor from an empty state to a state with a color value throws an error The error thrown is:    `Error: Expected 1 or 4 constructor parameters.`    This is coming from the `Color` constructor. Looks like the property's `valueConverter` is called from `parseKeyframeDeclarations` with a value which is already a `Color` instance, which is then passed into the `Color` constructor, which in turn doesn't expect it and throws the error. In fact, this might be a core NativeScript issue, because `valueConverter` expects a string.    This can be easily reproduced by running the following example, which throws as soon as it initializes as it transitions into the ""inactive"" state:    https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular/blob/eb3fd81c7bb4cdb9938feea13cd9e34b868e451a/ng-sample/app/examples/animation/animation-states-test.ts    Or the following simplified testcase:    ```typescript  import { Component } from ""@angular/core"";  import { trigger, style, animate, state, transition } from ""@angular/animations"";    @Component({      selector: ""animation-states"",      template: `          <StackLayout>              <Button text=""Touch me!""

I am trying to use this code for connecting to the WiFi:    <!-- language: lua -->        wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)            station_cfg={};      station_cfg.ssid=""netia9000"";      station_cfg.pwd=""mywifipassword"";      wifi.sta.config(station_cfg)      wifi.sta.connect()      status_of_wifi = wifi.sta.status()            if status_of_wifi == wifi.STA_IDLE then print(""IDLE"") end;      if status_of_wifi == wifi.STA_CONNECTING then print(""CONNECTING"") end;      if status_of_wifi == wifi.STA_WRONGPWD then print(""WRONG PS"") end;      if status_of_wifi == wifi.STA_APNOTFOUND then print(""404"") end;      if status_of_wifi == wifi.STA_FAIL then print(""500"") end;      if status_of_wifi == wifi.STA_GOTIP then print(""IP GOT"") end;            print(wifi.sta.getip())    But on console I can read following:        CONNECTING      nil    I tried to put the wrong data - a WiFi SSID that does not exist, a wrong `password, but no matter what I am still getting the same output: ""CONNECTING"" and ""nil"".    I used this code to check for available networks:        wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)            -- print ap list      function listap(t)            for ssid,v in pairs(t) do              authmode, rssi, bssid, channel =                 string.match(v, ""(%d),(-?%d+),(%x%x:%x%x:%x%x:%x%x:%x%x:%x%x),(%d+)"")              print(ssid,authmode,rssi,bssid,channel)            end      end                  wifi.sta.getap(listap)    And this worked perfectly fine. I got on the console:        netia9000       3       -52         e8:11:23:43:bf:a2:8f        10      -- other wi fi networks available nearby --    So it looks like the wifi module is fine and it's a software problem. I wrote the code according to [the documentation][1]. At this point I have no idea what's wrong. Any suggestions?      [1]: https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/modules/wifi/#wifistaconfig"

__label__question Plugin Serialization My previous MapWindow4 plugin implement overrides for ProjectLoading and ProjectSaving methods to add plugin specific state information that I wanted to save/serialize to the project file.  Looking through MapWindow5 I'm not finding an obvious replacement.  Unfortunately I'm more of a C++ guy than a C# guy but it looks like MW5 is leveraging the DataContractSerializer (wrapped by DataContractSerializer) to serialize XmlProject which has DataMembers that reference just about everything else.  The only Plugin Serialization that is done though appears to via the Plugins property of tthe XmlProject.  Unfortunately XmlPlugin is only one that doesn't use the DataContract and DataMember attributes.....  How is a plugin developer supposed to serialize to the project file?  Thought I'd ask just in case someone already knows this answer.  I'll continue digging.  Thanks!

__label__question "[IDEA] Generic object to delay work Hi,  I don't know how do you handle your jobs, but I end up creating a lot of small jobs whenever an operation do more than 2 HTTP calls to other services, or when I know the task will take some time.  To that extent, I have a lot of small jobs, whose only job is simply delaying to the service layer. For instance:  ``` php class DeleteUserJob extends AbstractJob {      private $userService;       public function __construct(UserService $userService)      {            $this->userService = $userService;      }       public function execute()      {           $this->userService->deleteUser($this->content['user_id']);      } } ```  I have tons of them and it's only boring to write. Couldn't we actually think of a way to make this more transparent and avoid all that boilerplate code?  I kinda like the work on Laravel and ""delayed commands"" (http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/bus). I'm not an expert of this bus command stuff, but it seems that each command can be decided to be delayed, by appending some kind of ""delay handler"". "

This is 100% not an issue but a question, so sorry for posting this here, but I don't see any other way to talk to the prepack community (any gitter/slack/etc channels?).    I'm having too much fun using prepack with interpreters & compilers. Today I was able to turn my interpreter, which interprets high-level instructions, almost into a compiler by running prepack on it with a given source code: https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/948247424023322624    I say ""almost"" because I don't really have a compiler yet. Prepack is running my VM and outputting the JS code itself. Evidently this is called [Futamura projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation#Futamura_projections). Since prepack isn't very fast though, this isn't extremely practical. I want just the raw compiler itself.    What I learned from that wiki page is we can take this even further. Supposedly I can generate an actual compiler by ""specializing the specializer for the interpreter"" - meaning run prepack on a program that runs prepack on the interpreter.    That would require prepack being able to run on itself. Is that possible? I'm going to try it tonight but given this is all blowing my mind, and I'm sure I'll run into problems, I'd like to know if anyone has tried that yet.    "

__label__question "CachedImage App Freeze and Memory Problems I am using a Xamarin Forms ListView to display images from the internet. (ListView has HasUnevenRows=true and no caching strategy defined, if of any relevance.)    These images are 400x400 max. jpeg images. They range between 24KB-145KB. I am showing 3 images in each row. Xamarin image views are 100x100 and I am using Samsung Galaxy S3 for testing (pixel ratio:2).    The problem is, when using CachedImage (FFImageLoding.Forms 2.2.9), I get out of memory exceptions as I start to scroll past about the middle of the list and some of the image views start to show empty. When I inspected, the size of these images are sometimes 30 KB, sometimes 90 KB. So size of the image is irrelevant.    I tried using CacheType=Disk, thinking that each seen image is cached in memory, but the result was the same    I tried setting DownSampleHeight and DownSampleWidth properties to 100. Then the out of memory exceptions went away and scroll became smoother. But the problem was that, when I was testing by scrolling constantly and quickly up and down the list, app freezed and never recovered. I tried again and the same result. I could not understand why, do you have an idea?    Another thing is, images are already of small size. With a Samsung Galaxy S8 (pixel ratio:4), there won't be any need to downsample anyway, so aside from the freeze, I feel like downsampling should not be necessary anyway.    So, I tried using the standard Image view of Xamarin Forms instead of CachedImage. It worked fine without any out of memory exceptions. (But since there is no downsampling here, I guess scrolling was not as smooth as the CachedImage with downsampling.)  And when I tested by scrolling constantly and quickly up and down the list, app did not freeze at all.    Bottom line is,    1. How come the standard Xamarin Forms Image view is not causing out of memory exceptions but CachedImage is, when not using downsampling?  2. What can be the reason of app freezing when using CachedImage with downsampling and doing constant and quick scrolling?    "
__label__question "Question about memory requirements I ran into problems with memory requirements. Initializing 68 data sources (Turtle files) with slightly more than 3 million triples in total results in a ""JavaScript heap out of memory"" exception. Merging all sources into one large source gives same result. I could get the server running with node option `--max-old-space-size` but it's still slow and the memory consumption seems rather high. Can you give some numbers of expected memory requirements and/or limitations? What do you recommend to server several million triples as LDF?    It looks like large data sets can only be used via SPARQL or external HDT files (or write your own data source that talks to an indexed set of triples, maybe I should do this for BEACON files)."

__label__question "Load 2.7.55 for testing. Here are the results I found. Before loading the new firmware I went to the <>Code section to read what all has been changed or has been added.  There is a lot there to understand. Several years ago I programed in C++ for my job. Documentation was mandatory before releasing the software for production.    Now here is what I found when I first turned the radio on.    1. There was no audio. I had to turn the radio off and back on to get audio.  2.  Here again the red TX led pulsed on and off with the audio pulsing in time with the red TX led.  3.  When pressing the menu button the red TX led went out and the audio pulsating stopped.  4. I turned the menu function off and the audio and red led started pulsating again. I pressed the DSP button to take the radio out of NR + Notch. The audio and red led problem went away. I found that A+Notch and M+Notch filtering dose not work to kill the carriers.  5. I went back to the menu functions and selected the DEBUG to make adjustments which did not help in get the notch filter working.    I went back to the <>Code to see if I missed something I was to set but I couldn't see anything I missed.    At this point I went back to version 2.7.31. This version works the beat for my clone radio. Although I still get audio muting sometimes when I let up on the PTT. Then I have restart the radio to get the audio back.    Best regards  WM0I    "

__label__question "Could someone familiar with hook rules, help me figure out how to parse this body? I am trying to figure out how to parse the body of a webhook message sent from node-sonos-http-api and have a match to an ID in my hooks.json config that matches when my Kitchen Sonos player (""roomName"":""Kitchen"",) is PLAYING and another when it is STOPPED (""playbackState"":""PLAYING"").  Below is the raw body of the webhook message that I am needing to create two rules for under one ID in my hooks.json file because the node-sonos-http-api only can send to a single webhook server url.

(So the first 4 bytes are hidden, and the space they left is filled by one big integer).  I also want to have fine-grained control over what bytes get grouped into what group.  So for example I want to group byte 0-4 into an Int32, and then leave 1 byte as it is, then group 6-7 into a custom display...

__label__question "documentation to extend Quran app for Hifz First of all,     May Allah Reward you and Bless you for opensourcing this amazing work. I'm a father, currently trying to help his son learn the Quran. he has learnt a few Juz, but now is struggling with his historical chapters (manzil). I'm trying to find patterns and track progress so our revisions can become much more efficient, but since we use a paper quran, the annotations become very convoluted and hard to follow.     That has made me look towards an IOS app on the ipad to help with this... I am trying to extend your app to be able to annotate on it to track his mistakes and trend them over time.     **1. Word by word:**  However, i'm trying to track this not by page but by ayah, and ideally by word. I'd started to create my own app pulling gif Quran pages down from the internet but soon realized this would not allow me to track to the level of granularity (i'd only be able to track # of mistakes/stucks/tajweed issues by page).    it was when I saw in one of your bug fixes that you have introduced word by word translation, started thinking  you have to have metadata recorded per word somewhere, which is exactly what I want to extend to add history of the mistakes with that word, and the datestamp when recorded.    **2. annotations per page**  I am also wanting to extend some visuals, track annotations page by page, something like this image below.     ![mockup-of-annotations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2871971/34701447-df146674-f4ad-11e7-9c11-069218e0f755.png)      These same annotations would drive the new metadata per word I was mentioning in #1 so in the above example something like     dateReviewed,surah#,page#,ayah#,word#,typeOfIssue  010618,002,003,008,007,Mistake  010618,002,003,008,009,Mistake  010618,002,003,010,008,TajwidError  010618,002,003,010,009,TajwidError  010618,002,003,010,013,TajwidError  ... and so on...  I've shown only the first 2 mistakes and 3 tajwid errors on the page in the metadata, but you get the idea...    since i'm sort of a newbie IOS developer, i'm trying to learn this over weekends; i'm not as adept in knowing where to look right now. once I understand how ios unit test framework works (like the maven convention for src/tests/...) I'll try to learn backwards from there as well..    at this point though, i'm quite lost!     I had a few questions if you could help me start off on...    1. Q1 how could I go about understanding where you keep metadata for your ayahs , and what the documentation or schema is.. so I can extend it for #1 above  2. Q2 any tips on how I can go about adding the columns and annotations on each page as shown, e.g. how do you render the page, where would i be adding these columns, and any other ideas on what Objects in the object library in your estimation would be best suited to capture these. I was thinking TableView and TableViewCell, but ended up crashing Xcode trying to add columns!  3. Q3 finally  do you have any basic documentation or pointers where I could start to understand your code has been laid out. historically when trying to reverse engineer code, I start from the file which the front page references and then categorically document each call from there on... but in this case , because of my own weak knowledge, i dont even know what file that would be :)       JAK again for your support and may Allah give you Jaza for every line of code you've written for this app and every bug you've fixed and each feature you've produced..

__label__question "Field values get preset to empty object for SimpleSchema field with type Object Problem: Value is initially {} instead of null/undefined    Actual: For a field that is type=Object + required=true, the ""required"" validation does not fail on the field itself.

__label__question "Questions while creating a more complex example Hi Guys,  I wish you a Merry Christmas.    I am trying to create an example to demonstrate the usage of our pipeline. I want to count all the words in a text file and print the 10 most used words (this problem just calls for a pipeline).    To solve this problem, I want to create a pipeline consisting out of the following 5 tasks:    - Task 1 reads the file line by line and forwards the read line to task 2.  - Task 2 separates the line into words and forwards each individual word to task 3.  - Task 3 converts each letter in a word to uppercase and forwards the word consisting only out of uppercase letters to task 4.  - Task 4 saves and counts the words. Every n words it triggers Task 5.  - Task 5 prints the top 10 most used words to the console.    I am unsure to implement the following behavior using our framework/pattern:  When created, task 1 opens a text file. Task 1 ""can_run"", because the EOF of the file has not been reached and Task 2 can process the next line (how do I know this?). So, Task 1 reads the next line and writes it to its output. Task 1 cannot run anymore because there is data in its output. Task 2 can run now because there is data in its input. Task 2 takes the line and begins processing it. At that moment Task 1 should be runnable again because its output has been read (how do I know this?). Now Task 1 reads the next line and writes it to its output while Task 2 is still processing the first line while handing the individual words down to Task 3.    My concrete sticking points are:    1. Task 2 ""can_run"" if it is still processing a line or if a new line is waiting in its input. Which run method should the scheduler call (every run forwards an individual word to Task 3)?  2. How does the scheduler know that Task 2 has read the output of Task 1 so it can execute Task 1 again?    There exist implementations where there are buffers between the tasks which store the input and output values. For example:    Say, there was a buffer 1 between Task 1 and Task 2 and a buffer 2 after Task 2 for example. Both, Task 1 and Task 2 can access buffer 1 while Task 2 has additional access to buffer 2. If buffer 1 is empty, the scheduler can obviously run Task 1 which writes a new line to buffer 1. Task 2 can be run, if buffer 2 is empty and (there is data in buffer 1 or Task 2 is still processing a line). If task 2 wasn't processing a line it would fetch the next line from buffer 1 which would enable task 1 to be run again.  "

__label__question "The choice of the number of quantizers per subvector in IndexIVFPQ Hi there,    I'm running IndexIVFPQ and notice that when I set nbits (the number bits to index sub-codebook) to 16 (2 bytes), FAISS would throw an assertion failure saying that nbits should be equal or less than 8. This would put a restriction on the maximal number of codewords per subvector to 256.     My understanding of PQ is that increasing nbits would significantly increase the number of codewords that can be represented without increasing memory footprint too much. This is because the total number of codewords is (2^nbits)^m (where m is the number of subvectors), the codebook size is (i.e., m * (2^nbits)), and the number of bytes per vector is (m * nbits / 8). Hence, increasing nbits will likely yield to a better memory-recall tradeoff.     The place where the exception is thrown is at the following place:  Error in faiss::IndexIVFPQ::IndexIVFPQ(faiss::Index*, size_t, size_t, size_t, size_t) at IndexIVFPQ.cpp:50: Error: 'nbits_per_idx <= 8' failed.   Also, in Figure 6 of the paper ""product quantization for nearest neighbor search"", K* is set to 4096, which is equivalent to nbits set to 12. I wonder if there are any particular reasons that in the current implementation nbits is limited to 8, and what I can do to increase nbits to larger values such as 16?        "

__label__question "[1.0] typescript definitions and ref I am currently migrating to 1.0.  I face an issue with typescript definitions  If i do this:  ```typescript  import TextField from 'material-ui/TextField';  interface Refs {       textfield: TextField  }  ```  i get a semantic error  ```  ts] Cannot find name 'TextField'.  ```  I think this is because ```TextField``` is defined as a ```const``` and not a class.  I also think this would prevent us from subclassing material-ui classes (definition wise).    on the same page it would be nice to be able to access the Props interface declaration for all material-ui component.  The use case is to create a custom element which draws a material-ui component and which Props extends that material-ui component    Thanks  "

Something like this:    ```  postRepository  .findAll()  .mapWithMono((post)->commentsRepository.count(post), (post, commentsCount) -> {      post.setCount(commentsCount);       return post;  })  ```    With streams I'd like to do  something like:    ```  postRepository  .findAll()  .stream()  .map(post -> post.setCommentsCount(commentsRepository.count(post))  .collect....  ```    I know that I can do .zipWith on flux but it takes a publisher not a function that will produce a publisher    Now, It's somehow possible with Mono by doing:    ```   @GetMapping(""posts/{id}"")      Mono<ResponseEntity<Post>> getPost(@PathVariable String id) {          return postRepository                  .findById(id)                  .zipWith(commentRepository.countCommentsByPostId(id), (post, commentsCount) -> {                      post.setCommentsCount(commentsCount);                      return post;                  })                  .map(ResponseEntity::ok)                  .defaultIfEmpty(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());      }    ```    But not with flux.

__label__question "Do we want to modify alipy? I am hoping by filing an ""issue"" here then an email chain gets triggered that goes to other members of this source repository. Is that right? Can anyone hear me?    I am looking at fixing two inter-related issues with the ioi pipeline.  i) Image registration fails on images with few, faint stars, but do look like registration ought to be possible.  ii) When image registration fails we get nothing out and the PI never sees the failed data. I propose we need to change the rules to still get the level 1 data product out, even if there is no level 2.    Both the above are easily fixable. My question is not really about ways to fix them, but what is our policy about maintenance of third party Python libraries on which we depend.    The registration is being performed by alipy (https://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/alipy/index.html). RMB has copied their source code into this repository. I.e., I believe we are using our own forked copy of alipy, not using a library that is installed in the Python environment as a dependency.    If I want to change the way alipy works, are we simply going to edit our copies of the alipy source files that exist within this repository? Once we do that we will have diverged from the ""official"" alipy release and will not be able to simply take and run any new alipy distribution that appears.  Looking at the above web page, the last update was 2013, so it seems alipy is not under active development.    To give you some context, I will describe the changes I want to make. alipy uses SExtractor to detect stars within an image and it does the quad alignment matching on those SExtractor catlogues. The alipy.pysex module has a mechanism for passing in either or both of a SExtractor config file or individual SExtractor config items on a one-by-one basis. It has an alipy.pysex._check_files method that sets defaults for required parameters that have not be explicitly set. Overall that looks quite nice and flexible. On the other hand alipy.ImgCat.makecat() then hardcodes a load of SExtractor options with no way to pass in your own values. (e.g., Detect sources as 10 connected pixels at 3sigma threshold, assuming stellar FWHM is 2pix)  Some of those values are not quite ideal of IOI. They are generally pretty good and work most of the time, but it would be more convenient if those source detection parameters were set in the ioi_pipeline runtime config file rather than hardcoded in alipy.    In order to do that though, the alipy code needs to be slightly integrated into ioi_pipeline so that parameters can be passed through. alipy would cease to be a completely external, independent black box.    So, basically my question is do I dive in and edit our local forked copy of alipy? If I have understood the situation correctly, the only reasons not to do that are things like  i) there is a newer version somewhere I do not know about that already offers the functions I want  ii) we know that a new master version of alipy is about to be released  "

__label__question """Invalid Security Token"" on admin login page When I try to login as admin on the login page (domain.org/admin) I get an ""Invalid Security Token"" error.  Just the login is broken, the website is working fine. Oddly enough, yesterday everything worked fine.    Before I go into more detail, here are my stats:  The server runs Ubuntu 16.04.1  Apache version: 2.4.18  PHP 7.0.22  Yesterday I upgraded Grav from 1.3.8 to 1.3.10  The Grav website itself was build on a different system and copied to the server Apache folder.    Because my used credentials are correct (I tested them on a different server on the same website) and the meaning of this error message, I think that the problem has something to do with the generated admin-nonce.    As far as I understand the source code the nonce is a md5 hash of    ```  $unhashedNonce = $i . '|' . $action . '|' . $username . '|' . $token . '|' . Grav::instance()['config']->get('security.salt');    $i = (int)ceil(time() / ($secondsInHalfADay));  $token = sessionId();  $username = 'gravadmin';  $action = 'admin-form';    ```  -> [(./src/Grav/Common/Utils.php - line 678).](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Utils.php)    To grant access to the admin interface the admin-nonce is tested, if it is generated during the last 12h. Which is done by generating a new one and compare it to the passed nonce:  ```      public static function verifyNonce($nonce, $action)      {            [...]            //Nonce generated 0-12 hours ago          if ($nonce == self::getNonce($action)) {              return true;          }            [...]  ```  ->[ (./src/Grav/Common/Utils.php - line 759)](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Utils.php)    I guess the problem lies in the generation of the salt but I'm a beginner with PHP so I'm absolutely not sure about this.  Does anyone have a hint or even a solution?"

__label__question "Extend syntax to support other media types Hello,    I would like to make a suggestion to extend the syntax.    The goal of the extension is to be able to display other media types inline without breaking compatibility with other applications.   One use case could be ""inline display of latex formulas"".  Other use cases are conceivable.    The basic syntax extension I would suggest would be an extension of the markdown image syntax:        ![Alternative Text](path/to/image)    to         ![Alternative Text](path/to/cached_image){mediatype:mediastring}    e.g.        ![f(x): R -> R](path/to/cached_image){latex:f(x): \\mathbb\{R\} -> \\mathbb\{R\}}      The behaviour of an editor **supporting the syntax** and **supporting the media type** should then be:   - render and display the content in the curly braces   - cache the rendered output in an image file      - either at the specified location      - or generate a unique (random) image file name and place it in a cache folder using that name. (e.g. `media/`)   - don't display the alternative text      The behaviour of an editor **supporting the syntax** but **not supporting the media type** should then be:    - display the cached image    - don't display the alternative text or the text in the curly braces      Editors which **do not support the syntax** but **support images** would display:    - the cached image    - the text in the curly braces    Surely making such a general syntax, only makes sense when other apps would at some point also jump in and support this syntax. But until then, this extension would not break the display in other apps and other apps could even see the rendered content through the cached image.    The first question would be if something like this could be merged at some point.  This is not a completely finished idea but I would love to here some input from others.    I hope I was able to make my point.  If not, feel free to ask and I will try to enhance my description.      Thank you for reading."
__label__question "Particle Photon collapses Hy there  Thanks a lot for this library for free. Ther is a lot of work in. I was so happy when the u8x8 ""Hello World"" worked from beginning.  Unfortunately I became a problem with u8g2 with the Microcontroller ""Photon"" from Particle.  If I use u8x8, ""Hello World"" is displayed, with a Display similar to the Midas MCOT128128 but also with the SSD1327-Controller, perfectly.  But with u8g2, the microcontroller collapses allready at u8g2.begin(). First I thought there is not enough of RAM, but with ""System.freeMemory();"" I got, that when the u8x8-Hello world is running, I have more than 60 kByte of free RAM. That should be more than enough. Also because the ""Photon"" (120 MHz, 128 kByte RAM) is much more powerful than every Arduino. And ""Particle"" tried to make her system libraries very simmilar to Arduino. I am allready running a lot of other arduino libraries with this microcontroller.  Is that perhaps the problem? Do I have to change SPI-speed? How can I do this? And how is choosen SPI or SPI1? I tried both with rewireing, but dint't work.  Because the u8x8 works fine, I don't realy know what the problem could be. Compiling works well without errors.  Page buffer mode I also didn't get working :(  And how can I use Hardware-SPI instead of Software-SPI with this non-Arduino myc? The pin assignement is different.    Thanks a lot for help.

__label__question "Question about connection pooling Hi, I have read the docs/examples but still confused about connection pooling.  First my req's:  1. maintain a pool of bound connections to the LDAP server.    2. These connections will be used synchronously to interact with my LDAP server.  3. When dao function is finished with connection, it simply returns it to the pool, shouldn't need to unbind/close the socket to the server.  4. A worker thread (in my program) may only access one LDAP connection at a time.  5. No two threads may access the same LDAP connection.    Here is how I am (attempting to) initialize the connection the server connection pool:  server = ldap3.Server( host='localhost', port=389 )  c = ldap3.Connection(server, user=service_uid, password=service_pw, auto_bind=True, collect_usage=True, pool_name='blah', pool_size=5, pool_lifetime=600, pool_keepalive=30 )    My confusion is two-fold:  a. how to get a new connection from the pool.  do I just call the code as listed above, or is there another way?  b. how do I return a connection to the pool?    Any samples you can point me to are appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your attention to this.      Shawn McKinney"

__label__question "task with other promise implementations Hi.    We're using Bluebird as our promise implementation in a project, and I'd like to use `Task` in there too. Alas, `Task` enforces standard ES6 promises. At the moment, I've basically copied the entire `Task.ts` file into my own project and `s/Promise/Bluebird/` and `s/Task/BTask/`. This is working fine for me, but obviously I'd be better off if `fp-ts` supported either promise library natively.     I think supporting both seems tricky though, unless you know of some magic generics incantation or something.....    Any ideas?     Cheers"
__label__question "Suggestion: Avoid the use of global configuration and objects I found this library while looking for modern and easy ways of adding localization to my Node service. It's pretty much the only one which uses string tag functions and still supports standard variable replacements without inventing a new syntax. Brilliant! However, it doesn't seem to suite my use case as I'll have to handle multiple different translations in parallel, e.g. respond to parallel requests in different languages. Or maybe I just don't really understand how to use it?    I'm looking for something where I can instantiate multiple `i18n` string tag functions, each with a different locale and string table. I thus forked this repo locally and built something that works more like this:    ```js  import { I18n } from ""./i18"";    const i18n = I18n.create({ locales: ""de"" });  console.log(i18n`Hello ${name}, you have ${amount}:c in your bank account.`);  // => Hallo Steffen, Sie haben US$ 1,250.33 auf Ihrem Bankkonto.  ```    I feel this is a cleaner interface and better scoped. Would that be something to consider for a v2 of this lib? What are your thoughts about this?"

Will I still be able to do this? Any chance I could get a little example selecting another form using PDO in the preparser? Or is the scope of pre-parser's reach now limited to the $_POST values?        "

__label__question "status_backend replacement? I read in the changelog that the config switch ""status_backend"" was removed for OffineIMAP 7.1.0 but no reason was given and no replacement was mentioned: https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap/blob/master/Changelog.md    As far as I understood it, the default was a plain text and optional a sqlite backend could be used, mainly for performance reasons on large mail boxes. So what does the removal of this config switch effectively means? Are the performance problems of the plain text file no longer an issue? Does OfflineIMAP now always uses a sqlite database? Is there any new config switch which replaces the old one?"

__label__question "Python plugin API for OpenShot a good method for persistent data? (I had posted on the user forum and was directed here due to the nature of the question)    This may seem redundant at first since one can program plugins in Blender and can access openshotlib via Python, but I have pointed out some fine details and use cases of having this type of API that would open up whole new categories of plugins...    I would like to help OpenShot to be able to write plugins (and I would like to write plugins) such as frame-painting plugins; another category of plugins that generate or use motion estimation data (such as anti-shake or motion matching plugins--they could even both get the data from the same motion estimation plugin else show error on screen if motion estimation info is not available for the frame of the footage file); and possibly other categories of plugins which would also use persistent data in some way. Both categories of plugins would be highly dependent on footage staying the same, so py (or however programmed) plugins may need to be required to have a get_context_list function that could return [""footage"",""clip"",""track"",""master""] (but that would return only [""media""] in this case). There definitely would need to be a warning but not necessarily block the person if they want to risk frame painting on a clip such as after a color adjustment effect. There would also need to be a get_content_list function that would return something like [""video""] or [""audio""] or [""image""] or [""video"",""image""]. The py file should be able to get and set info somehow such as:  ```  openshot.plugin_context.media.content_string #returning [""video""] or [""audio""] or [""image""]  openshot.plugin_context.media.path #returning full path of clip, such as to store motion estimation data to the same folder  #also store persistent data in memory (of arbitrary name and type) between frames:  if openshot.plugin_context.my_variable_1 is not None:      openshot.plugin_context.my_variable_1 = QImage() #pretend I wrote something legit after the equal sign  #where plugin_context is the instance of the plugin as applied to a specific media object  #it may also need to get the frame number and rate or timecode (at least global time, but possibly also time relative to clip), such as for beat matching, or so it can have an option to reset a cumulative effect such as motion blur  ```  Regarding uses of such an API not highly dependent on unchanging sources, but that might also require a python API or other API, named outputs and inputs (that can be piped together) would be great--such as a plugin that detects and outputs ""bass"" from audio track, then that (0 to 1) value can be used as an input for a brightness (or other) video plugin selectable from drop-down (possibly node interface if anyone wants to program that).    I recommend against writing a plugin API that requires binary plugins, since that is a big pain for developers (such as, if I go on another computer, I have to make sure my IDE is setup properly there and possibly deal with version issues related to Qt or other libraries). Also, I know that libopenshot is accessible from Python and that I would be able to write my own video editing program, but that is not really interesting to me. I'd rather stick with OpenShot since it already has a great interface). I don't currently know the coding of OpenShot in depth, nor future plans--so that's why I ask, is writing a Python API for OpenShot a good idea to accomplish these goals?"

__label__question "Questions about migration to PlayRho! Some questions i have about the project (esp. in relation to Box2D) that @louis-langholtz or someone else might just know the answer to, in order to spare me writing tests and possibly pointless reintegrations.    - How does the performance of the 32/64/fixed32/fixed64 version compare to it's counterparts? Is using the fixed-point implementation on worlds containing roughly (low)hundreds of bodies at all feasible?    - How do the float-types impact maximum scale ratios between bodies in this engine? Can this get me beyond Box2D's 0.1m - 10m rule for bodys' sizes and maybe even beyond 0.1m - ~1000m?    - Apart from namespacing and renaming - what are the most obvious pitfalls one might encounter migrating from Box2D to PlayRho in an existing project?    - Are there any plans to implement liquidfun's additions to Box2D in PlayRho? (ParticleSystems)    - I read about 3D in the issues - will this project move away from a pure 2D engine? and if so will the API for the 2D usage as well as the 2D performance of the engine change/suffer due to that change?    My hopes are that i can more or less drop in PlayRho as a replacement for Box2D and get a similar performance but stronger determinism (syncing Box2D over network is... tedious to say the least) on a larger range of scale.

However the whole function is taking on average 5 secs and sometimes up to 10 seconds to implement. I can't understand how to optimise code.     Here is the editImage function which implements async.waterfall, where source image from s3 bucket is downloaded. And then it puts text on downloaded image and then uploads result to destination key.          exports.editImage = function(event, context, callback) {       // init and assign vars       async.waterfall([         async.apply(download, srcBucket, srcKey),         async.apply(editAsset, text),         async.apply(upload, dstBucket, dstKey)       ], function (err) {            if (err) console.log('Unable to transform image');                       callback(null, {statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ key: dstKey})             });           }         );      };        function download(srcBucket, srcKey, callback) {        var params = {Bucket: srcBucket, Key: srcKey};          s3.getObject(params, callback);      };        function editAsset(text, response, callback) {         var img = gm(response.Body);         img.size(function (err, { height }){            img.drawText(0, height / 2 - 40, text.toUpperCase(), 'center');            img.toBuffer('png', function (err, buffer) {            if (err) console.log(err);            callback(null, response, buffer);         });       });      }        function upload(dstBucket, dstKey, response, buffer, callback) {        s3.putObject({            Bucket: dstBucket,            Key: dstKey,            Body: buffer,            ContentType: response.ContentType        }, function(err, data) {        if (err) {            console.log(err, err.stack);        }else{            callback(null, response, buffer);        }       });      }      The code works.

__label__question "Nested ternaries aren't bad, just misused The argument against nested ternaries is that they can make code more difficult to understand. But they can make code easier to understand if they are wielded properly. Instead of banning nested ternaries, require that they are formatted such that **each line has a single condition and a single result**, with the catch-all at the end:    ```  // bad  const foo = maybe1 > maybe2    ? ""bar""    : value1 > value2 ? ""baz"" : null;    // good  const foo =    maybe1 > maybe2 ? ""bar""    : value1 > value2 ? ""baz""    : null;  ```    This is similar to a switch statement that always `break`s. With this pattern, it's impossible to get lost in nested contexts. Once you've ruled out a line applying to the case you're considering, you can safely forget it. It's easier to understand than the solutions provided by the style guide right now, and also saves a memory allocation.    Here are some other examples where this pattern improves code:    ```  // bad  let result;  if (operator === ‘+’) {    result = left + right;  } else if (operator === ‘*’) {    result = left * right;  } else if (operator === ‘-’) {    result = left — right;  } else {    result = left / right;  }    // good  const result =    operator === ‘+’ ? left + right    : operator === ‘*’ ? left * right    : operator === ‘-’ ? left — right    : left / right;  ```    * Less code.  * Prefers `const` over `let`.  * Avoids side effects (i.e. assigning value of variable outside block scope).    ```  // bad  if (conditionA) {    outcome1();  } else if (conditionB) {    if (conditionC) {      outcome2();    } else {      outcome3();    }  } else {    outcome4();  }    // good  conditionA ? outcome1()  : conditionB && conditionC ? outcome2()  : conditionB ? outcome3()  : outcome4();  ```  * Less code.  * Less cognitive load.

__label__question "Usage outside of Java projects I came across Karate while looking for automated API testing tools and found that it seemed to meet my requirements really nicely. However, after trying to get it to work all day within the context of a Go project, I've came to the conclusion it's not intended to be used outside of Java projects. Ideally I'd be able to test my API endpoints with minimal Java stuff cluttering up my Go project. However, after creating the pom.xml, build.gradle and comparing what I have to what the read / examples have, I'm not sure why my test runner and feature files aren't being detected.

__label__question "Question: Automate naming and packaging I'm not familiar with gulp to know how to change the code or if my idea is even worth changing! From my understanding is FoundationPress is a set of starter files, like underscores for WordPress. So I can take FoundationPress and rename it to my shiny new theme name.    However [http://underscores.me/](http://underscores.me/) has a generate page that will go through, theme name, slug, author, author uri, description and generate your parent starter theme zip package. I think it even rename the functions to your theme name as well. So is there a way of replicating this setup for FoundationPress for those who want use the starter files but under a different theme name?    Otherwise once I have `git clone [...] my-new-theme`, I then need to manually update styles.css and package.json with the new theme name. So given npm generates everything else could using the config.yml to automatically populate style.css details and change the package.json 'name' so when you `npm run package` you will get your new zipped theme named and generated. Rather then be left with the default `foundationpress-[date].zip` and if you have remebered to change the styles.css file.     I'm think this is more useful when you have finally finished developing you're parent theme and want to use versions numbers for updates after each `npm run package`.. I'm not totally sure if my thinking is even correct and I'm sure something like this has come up before, although I couldn't find reference to it. But FP with npm and gulp does such a good job of automating everything else apart from dealing with with those wanting use FoundationPress as SomethingElsePress.  "

__label__question "HLS: Retry Failed Connections Currently working with HLS, and the streaming server isn't know for stability.     My current issue now is informing the player to attempt to reconnect on failed connections, currently working around this by waiting for the media state to end, then programmatically telling the player to play the same stream again.    Something along the lines of MediaElement.ReConnect(bool RetryOnFail, int RetryAttempts, int TimeBetweenAttemptsInMs)    If there's a way to do this outside of the api, without hacking it too much, lemme know.    Edit:  I have located the Options inputted into MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs, which i think i manipulate for now, but exposing something like MediaElement.Options to add options to the player before playing the video would be beneficial.     Edit 2:  Filing tickets at 5AM on little sleep is a bad idea kids. Solution to manipulating the Http headers/user agent and reconnect attempts is to add a new event to Media Initializing event handler to the player.  Here you can add options to the MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs passed (e.Option.Input). Which should take effect before starting the stream. Going to test for effectiveness.     Edit 3:  This issue seems to be at FFMPEGs level. Further looking into it, there doesn't seem to be any command line arguments to attempt to reconnect to a forbidden or 404 more than once. I will keep this up dated but it seems like this might have to be handled by reading when FFMPEG fails and try to reconnect using the same video buffer if it succeeds."

__label__question "[Doc, enhancement] Consider 2.0 migration guide? I spent an hour or two trying to upgrade to 2.0 yesterday and gave up - it's just not worth anything to me beyond being able to stay current.  I'll probably try again in a few months - but if it's a hassle I'll start looking at other options.    IMHO, 2.x does little new that will motivate most current users to upgrade, if they're getting what they need now.  I'm not saying it wasn't a good idea, just pointing out that the effort required for upgrading needs to be minimized to pull folks forward who are just motivated by trying to keep up-to-date.  In the context of the tiny API footprint, 2.x is is a tough upgrade, but mostly for reasons that might be fairly easily mitigated by a little doc.      1.) Dumb, I know, but yesterday I couldn't think how to look back to the 1.x docs without cloning from it.  Consider a link to https://github.com/souporserious/react-measure/tree/1.4.7 for comparison.    2.) Summarize the API changes, probably including a before-after table for each 1.x prop.  A simple example: 1.x had `onMeasure`; what prop or design-pattern should I use in 2.x in it's place? `onResize`?    3.) Show before/after for common usage patterns?  "

This is an unfortunate consequence of the naming convention where `mkFoo` is promoted to `MkFoo`.    Now, I quite like this naming convention, so I'm not proposing we change that. Rather, I propose something more... modest? I propose that we not generate defunctionalization symbols for the `MkFoo` constructor at all.    After all, we don't need to! Promoted constructors are one of the few things that can currently be partially applied at the type level in GHC, so instead of using defunctionalization symbols, we can just use `'MkFoo`, `TyCon1 'MkFoo`, and `TyCon2 'MkFoo` as appropriate. This would require changing some code generation in `singletons` to accommodate the change, but I think it would be possible.    The downside to this proposal is that some folks quite like having defunctionalization symbols for constructors. We could make this opt-in by still allowing users to write `$(genDefunSymbols [''Foo])` if they really want it. However, this behavior would _not_ be implied by `promote` or `singletons`."

__label__question "Add support for required flag to input filters I know this is not a discussion board or Stack Overflow, however, having tried to find a solution to my problem (which I'm sure I'm not only one having) I wanted to raise a discussion about the following issue. There's a possibility that I've missed something along the way but I'll ask nonetheless.    Currently there doesn't seem to be a way to set input filter nested inside another input filter as required. Requirements seem to be based on the input (and not input filter) nearest to the root of the object.    To illustrate what I mean, assume the following API endpoint payload, which eventually gets converted to a PHP array:    ```json  {    ""root"": {      ""branch"": {        ""leaf"": false      }    }  }  ```    If understand correctly then the only way to build validation for the specified structure is to have an input filter class for the whole object, which has an input filter attached for the `root` key, which in turn has an input filter class attached for `branch`. The latter one then has an input attached to it validating the value.    In my use case, it is not required to specify `branch` when posting the payload, however, if it's present, `leaf` has to be validated to make sure that the value is a boolean value.    Currently the only way to avoid the `Value is required and can't be empty` on the `leaf` property is to set is as not required, which obviously isn't how it should be.    I've been looking through the source code and, correct me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't look like there's any functionality allowing to specify that a nested input filter is required or not. Is it a deliberate decision or something that's not been implemented or requested? Alternatively, maybe there's a different solution to achieve the same exact result I need?"

__label__question "Invalid object name 'Clients' Hello,  I am trying to generate migrations from a project hosting the Identity Server 4.  The project is configured with .NET core 2 and using the NUGET packages:    - IdentityServer4 (2.1.1)  - IdentityServer4.EntityFramework (2.1.1)    I've configured the Startup.cs as it should be, for instance:    ````  .AddConfigurationStore(options =>   {  	options.ConfigureDbContext = builder =>  		builder.UseSqlServer(connectionString,  		sql => sql.MigrationsAssembly(migrationsAssembly));  })  ````  Also, I've added a DesignTimeFactory class as follows:    ````  public ConfigurationDbContext CreateDbContext(string[] args)          {              IConfigurationRoot configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()                  .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())                  .AddJsonFile(""appsettings.json"")                  .Build();              var builder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ConfigurationDbContext>();              var connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString(""DefaultConnection"");              builder.UseSqlServer(connectionString, o => o.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(DesignTimeConfigurationDbContextFactory).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name));              var options = new ConfigurationStoreOptions();              return new ConfigurationDbContext(builder.Options, options);          }  ````  Then, I create an empty Database manually.

__label__question "Caret extension Hi,  I use the lockInput property to disable the native keyboard which makes the input field readonly. This also removes the cursor from the text area.

__label__question "HLS: Retry Failed Connections Currently working with HLS, and the streaming server isn't know for stability.     My current issue now is informing the player to attempt to reconnect on failed connections, currently working around this by waiting for the media state to end, then programmatically telling the player to play the same stream again.    Something along the lines of MediaElement.ReConnect(bool RetryOnFail, int RetryAttempts, int TimeBetweenAttemptsInMs)    If there's a way to do this outside of the api, without hacking it too much, lemme know.    Edit:  I have located the Options inputted into MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs, which i think i manipulate for now, but exposing something like MediaElement.Options to add options to the player before playing the video would be beneficial.     Edit 2:  Filing tickets at 5AM on little sleep is a bad idea kids. Solution to manipulating the Http headers/user agent and reconnect attempts is to add a new event to Media Initializing event handler to the player.  Here you can add options to the MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs passed (e.Option.Input). Which should take effect before starting the stream. Going to test for effectiveness.     Edit 3:  This issue seems to be at FFMPEGs level. Further looking into it, there doesn't seem to be any command line arguments to attempt to reconnect to a forbidden or 404 more than once. I will keep this up dated but it seems like this might have to be handled by reading when FFMPEG fails and try to reconnect using the same video buffer if it succeeds."

__label__question "Installation of IJavascript using Anaconda installed by root (sudo su) in Ubuntu 16.04 I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Jupyterhub 0.8.1, jupyter 4.4.0    A little backstory:  In the instructions it says you can do this when you have everything in conda anyway:  conda install nodejs   npm install -g ijavascript  This however does not work.    That step resulted in the similar permission error for zmq as some other people have had. Someone said I should install nodejs globally, I'm not sure how to install globally with conda, it does'nt provide flags for installing packages specifically global. It seemed the permission was because it lacked permission to get to /root/.npm but I was running the commands as root.    Here is where npm/node/nodejs was installed in conda and versions:  ```  root@jupyter:# which node  /opt/conda/bin/node  root@jupyter:# node --version  v8.9.3  root@jupyter:# which nodejs  /usr/bin/nodejs  root@jupyter:# nodejs --version  v4.2.6  root@jupyter:# which npm  /opt/conda/bin/npm  root@jupyter:# npm --version  5.5.1  ```    So I ended up installing nodejs and npm through apt-get  ```  sudo su  apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm  /usr/bin/npm install -g ijavascript  ijsinstall  ```    Now this is the versions and where they are installed  ```  root@jupyter:# which node  /usr/bin/node  v4.2.6  root@jupyter:# node --version  v4.2.6  root@jupyter:# which nodejs  /usr/bin/nodejs  root@jupyter:# nodejs --version  root@jupyter:# which npm  /usr/bin/npm  root@jupyter:# npm --version  3.5.2  ```  Running ijsinstall, then the kernel is installed into /root, so I had to cd into /root/.local/share/jupyter/kernels  and then execute  jupyter kernelspec install dir  i.e. `jupyter kernelspec install javascript`    and this install method worked!  But starting a notebook I am getting an error on line 190 in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ijavascript/lib/kernel.js    This is the debug log from /var/log/jupyterhub/jupyterhub.log:  ```  [I 2018-02-12 15:02:28.302 SingleUserNotebookApp restarter:103] KernelRestarter: restarting kernel (2/5)  KERNEL: ARGV: [ '/usr/bin/nodejs',    '/usr/local/bin/ijskernel',    '--hide-undefined',    '-h',    '/home/sigurdur/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-9c5bff57-ed88-4b3d-aa3f-ab593feda4a3.json',    '--protocol=5.0' ]  Usage: node kernel.js [--debug] [--hide-undefined] [--protocol=Major[.minor[.patch]]] [--session-working-dir=path] [--show-undefined] [--startup-script=path] connection_file  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ijavascript/lib/kernel.js:190    ```    Here is that code.

But I would like to know if this is a real issue with the arguments(see the debug log) or if this should maybe be fixed in the repo."

__label__question "Variation on the 2FA locked out of wallet question Hi guys, I would be very grateful if you could point me in the right direction on this!    After going travelling and not opening my electrum wallet for many months, and losing my old phone (and therefore google authenticator app) I was unable to send any bitcoins on return.    I read that I had to restore the old wallet using my seed to disable 2FA. However, when doing so, I tried to restore a standard wallet by accident, instead of a 2FA. This created a new wallet with a tiny amount of bitcoins with odd looking transaction amounts. My full wallet remained unchanged. (see image)    When I then try and restore using the 2FA option, and type in my seed, it says ""old seed"". I am only given the option to extend it with custom words.    If I try to restore as a default wallet, it also says old seed. I am only offered the option to try the seed as a BIP39, but this only creates a totally empty wallet. Having done a bit of research, the words in my seed seem to pre-date BIP39. I have been upgrading electrum since around 2013.    When trying to restore as a multi-sig wallet, I also have to enable BIP39 such that the next button is un-greyed. If I follow this course, it gives me a master public key and asks for a cosigner key or seed. I have tried entering a master private key from looking at my wallet.dat file which was unsuccesful.    When attempting to restore by sweeping private keys saved from my full bitcoin wallet, this only brings up an ""electrum 3.0.6 has stopped working"" error over the please wait window.    I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling electrum to no avail.    I messaged trustedcoin but they haven't responded as of yet.    Is there any way I can get access to my btc?    Was there an automatic switch to 2FA that I have forgotten about?    Will trying to import the keys on the bitcoin core client / completely different PC make any difference?

__label__question "Forward Kinematics Improvements I have a few kinematics questions.  I don't claim to understand all of this math very well, so any guidance would be appreciated.    First, I noticed an oddity that I don't know if I caused or if this has always been there.  If when set to quadrilateral kinematics I     1. set the left chain to 0 and the right chain to 1650, and $K (recompute kinematics) I get an error (unable to find sled position).  2. set the left chain to 1650 and rerun $K. I still get an error.  3. restart GC and the sled position is properly calculated.    I chased this down and the issue is that Phi eventually becomes nan and this is only reset on a complete restart.  Adding the initial declared value of Phi = -0.2 to recomputeKinematics fixes the issue.  Has this been an oversight?  What does Phi represent?  Will resetting it cause an issue?    Second, I thought it would be nice to not have to call $K anymore and to update the kinematics whenever a relevant setting is changed.  The issue is that forward kinematics can take up to 6 seconds to fail out and with ~6 settings that affect kinematics this sucks a bit.    I added in an additional threshold in forward, if the guessed chain length exceeds the 11 foot chain length then the forward calculation ends early.  This is about a 10x savings in time, and means that forward fails in about 700 milliseconds (much more reasonable).  The calculations seems to work fine in all other respects.    I would make the chain length a user setting so that it isn't hardcoded at 11 feet.  Does anyone see any issues with this approach?  In watching the forward calculations I didn't see any instances where the guessed chain length gets larger than the allowed length only to turn around and become smaller again.    "

__label__question "[Suggestion] Method to match Muuri internal state to DOM state  I'm writing a library to bridge Muuri and Vue 2.x.  Since Vue is reactive, I'm running into problems when the parent component alters the prop that it's sending to my Muuri component.    As an example, here's some dummy code and a simple explanation of a problem I'm facing:    ```html  <div class='v-muuri-grid>    <div class='v-muuri-item' v-for='item in list'>      <div class='v-muuri-item-content'>        {{ item.name }}      </div>    </div>  </div>  ```  If you're unfamiliar with Vue, this will create one `v-muuri-item` for each element of `list`.  However, since Vue will change the elements of this list reactively, It's very hard to keep Vue and Muuri in sync.    **Scenario:**  1. `list` contains `['a', 'b', 'c']`.  This is passed to Vue, creating a DOM element for each item  2. Using Muuri, I drag item `'c'` to the 0th index  3. Listening to `grid.on('move')`, I then update `list` so its structure matches the DOM structure (`list` is now `['c', 'a', 'b']`)  4. Due to reactivity, this causes a re-render, changing the display names of the items.  _However_, since the Muuri representation of these items doesn't update when the DOM does, the display names become `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` again, leaving `list` out of sync with Muuri.    [Here's a video](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNd9VeeQTNGweUu5O/giphy.gif  ) of this happening.  Notice that the box labels change to the wrong label when the Vue state changes.    ___    Now, this one issue isn't hard for me to fix.  But handling the reactivity when an array is added to, deleted from, or replaced is pretty convoluted.    My suggestion is a method that reevaluates Muuri's internal state based on the current DOM.  Kind of like `synchronize`, but in reverse.    Thank you for this great library!  "

Now for how I know that it's not doing me right.  From my local docker (running under boot2docker on a mac), I can do:  ``` $ docker login mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000 User: someuser Password: somepassword Email: WARNING: login credentials saved in /Users/waynew/.docker/config.json Login Succeeded $ docker pull busybox $ docker tag busybox mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/busybox $ docker push mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/busybox # docker does its push thing $ docker exec -it example_testminion_1 bash root@testminion# docker -H docker:2375 mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000 User: someuser Password: somepassword Email: WARNING: login credentials saved in /root/.docker/config.json Login Succeeded root@testminion# docker -H docker:2375 pull mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/busybox ```  And everything is A-OK. However, if **instead** of doing the exec bash/enter thing, I simply run `state.highstate`... there is sadness :sob:   ``` testminion:     The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py"", line 1036, in _thread_return         return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py"", line 3602, in pull         response = _image_wrapper('pull', repo_name, **kwargs)       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py"", line 569, in wrapper         return wrapped(*args, **salt.utils.clean_kwargs(**kwargs))       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py"", line 872, in _image_wrapper         registry=registry)       File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/api/daemon.py"", line 71, in login         return self._result(response, json=True)       File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/client.py"", line 146, in _result         self._raise_for_status(response)       File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/client.py"", line 142, in _raise_for_status         raise errors.APIError(e, response, explanation=explanation)     APIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error (""invalid registry endpoint https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v0/: unable to ping registry endpoint https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v0/     v2 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority      v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v1/_ping: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.

But it gets a bit weirder, and I didn't try this until just now.

__label__question "How to know when an actor is available. Suppose we create a handful of actors, assign a task to each, and want to assign a new task to an actor whenever that actor becomes available. `ray.wait` allows us to know when an ""object"" is available, but what we really want is an easy mapping from the object ID to the actor object.    Some options:    1. If the actors are stored in a list, then pass the actor's index in the list into the actor constructor and return it from the relevant method.  2. Maintain a dictionary mapping object ID to actor.    Note that in a lot of these situations, the actors are considered interchangeable for the purposes of the application, so this might be addressed by creating ""stateless"" actors whose identities don't matter and where multiple replicas of the actor are hidden behind a single object that we call methods on."

__label__question "No pull requests accepted in 2 months - is project still live? Electron.NET is an incredibly exciting project. As expected for an alpha- or pre-alpha project, it has serious and entirely expected new-project teething pains. Electron.NET is a cross-platform toolkit that doesn't yet work across platforms, it's a developer tool that doesn't yet work in debug mode, and it has a large and rapidly growing community of developers rallying around it and trying to use it.    But it has not accepted a PR in over two months. These aren't complex and subtle PR's that require tens of maintainer hours just to assess that are waiting to be accepted. These are minor tweaks to Readme's.    I've been [a huge fan of Electron.NET](https://github.com/yoDon/Electron.NET-React-Typescript-MobX), I remain a huge fan of Electron.NET, but if the maintainers refuse to accept PR's or can't invest the time to accept even the most trivial of PR's, we need to ask is this project still live?    I don't want to do this, but I have to start porting the projects I started on Electron.NET away from Electron.NET. That makes me profoundly sad. Electron.NET is a brilliant project. It is how I want to develop my applications. But there is no point in me or anyone else trying to fix the issues Electron.NET faces if no PR's are being accepted and no maintainer commits are happening either.    Two months with no PR accepts and no maintainer commits is a long time. Too long. Spending time tagging issues as ""bug"" or ""feature"" and ""assigning"" maintainers to them doesn't fix issues and isn't a solution to anything.    Is this project still live?    Is there a plan in place to allow it to succeed?  "

__label__question "Access denied to mounted volume through Flask App I am a newbie to mono, and I am also a newbie to .NET programming, but it is necessary for a project that I am working on.    I am experiencing a problem that is kind of weird--at least to my untrained eye.  I'm using docker mono to run a small app that reads a pst file located on a volume mounted to the container.      `/usr/sbin/mono exeFile.exe args`     is controlled with a flask app that calls the mono program as a subprocess    ```  def convert(self, pst):          pst_file = pst['fldr']          pst_acc_name = pst['acc_name']          p = subprocess.Popen(['/usr/bin/mono', './tomes_pst_extractor/TomesPst2Mime.exe', pst_file, pst_acc_name],                               stdout=subprocess.PIPE, bufsize=1, close_fds=self.on_posix)          q = Queue()          t = Thread(target=self.enqueue_out, args=(p.stdout, q))          t.daemon = True          self.sendMessage(self.get_message_for_sending(2, ""Processing: {}"".format(os.path.join(self.pst_home, pst_acc_name))))          t.start()  ```    I'm getting this exception:  `Exception: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path '/home/tomes/data/pst/ is denied.`    If I `exec` into the container and execute the command from `/bin/bash` the process works flawlessly.    Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thank you."
__label__question "Community development and release process While we're transitioning to the new Github organization, this is the perfect time to discuss our process for collaboration. Here is what I propose: - For each new release, create a milestone in GH issues and populate it with tickets. - Work on a fork of ruby-llvm/ruby-llvm or in a local branch. - Issue a pull request against ruby-llvm/ruby-llvm master. - Verify that the changes are successful and close the issue.  I would like to continue tracking LLVM's release cycle, with a new release trailing each LLVM release using the LLVM version number as the first two digits of the ruby-llvm version, and subsequent releases updating the patch version.  That said, I'm open to any suggestions from the community that improve quality, efficiency or fun. "

__label__question "General questions about how functions are  scaled Hi, Community,    Hope this is the right place to ask this kind of questions. I'm trying to understand how Azure Functions are scaled.  Base on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale, ""Azure Functions uses a component called the scale controller to monitor the rate of events and determine whether to scale out or scale in. The scale controller uses heuristics for each trigger type. For example, when you're using an Azure Queue storage trigger, it scales based on the queue length and the age of the oldest queue message."" So which part of the source code of Azure-WebJobs-Script is ""scale controller""? I see [src/WebJobs.Script/](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/tree/dev/src/WebJobs.Script), but I did not see the monitor there."

When apache kills it off, the child nodejs processes are left behind.    None of those debug events fire. No ""disconnect"", ""SIGINT"", ""SIGTERM"", etc. Eventually, I will do `killall nodejs` and the SIGTERM events will fire. But the child nodejs process doesn't get any of those signals when the ts-node process is killed off.    I'm just curious if you've tried it yet or if you can offer any insight. Thanks!"

__label__question "Explicit comparisons for strings are a bad practice because they don't account for null/undefined. For strings, the guide states:    > 15.3 Use shortcuts for booleans, but explicit comparisons for strings and numbers.  > ```  > // bad  > if (name) {  >   // ...  > }  >   > // good  > if (name !== '') {  >   // ...  > }  > ```    However, this is actually a bad practice for strings because it doesn't account for other falsey values like `undefined` or `null`. The developer may not always control the initial state of a variable if it's loaded from an API, so using explicit checks against empty strings is likely to result in subtle bugs in your code. To truly be safe, you'd have to do `if (name !== undefined && name !== null && name !== '') {`, which is pretty terrible.    For most things, you only care about ""do I have a value"". For this, the ""bad"" check is actually the most elegant and safe way to do this.    ```  if (name) {  ```    On StackOverflow, the ""bad"" answer has by far the most votes as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/154059/how-do-you-check-for-an-empty-string-in-javascript/154068#154068     Would you guys consider changing this?"

__label__question "Create a WaypointTrajector class Currently both the `Spline` class and the `Interpolated` class have a few methods for ""waypoints"", which are `getNumWaypoints()`, `getWaypoint(i)` and `getWaypointTime(i)`, which are not inherited from the base class `Trajectory`.  Those methods are mostly called in converting to some implicit path format, for example `DynamicPath` in `computeParabolicTiming()`.     @brianhou  suggested creating an abstract class `WaypointTrajectory` (in between base class `Trajectory` and `Interpolated` \ `Spline`) and defining all the ""waypoints"" operations in this class.  The change will merge conversions based on ""waypoints"" from both `Interpolated` and `Spline` into a single method, which will remove duplicate code.    A very minor concern is that whether it is fair to consider `Spline` as a `WaypointTrajectory`.  Because `Spline` is a sequence of line segments.   The ""waypoints"" of a `Spline` is ""indirectly"" obtained from segments.  https://github.com/personalrobotics/aikido/blob/master/src/trajectory/Spline.cpp#L206  https://github.com/personalrobotics/aikido/blob/master/src/trajectory/Spline.cpp#L226    We would like to hear some comments before making the change."

This is my code.          const Koa = require('koa')      const Router = require('koa-router')            const timeout = (ms) => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms))      const timestamp = () => {          const d = new Date()          return `${d.getUTCMinutes()}:${d.getUTCSeconds()}`      }      let req = 0            const app = new Koa()            app.use(async (ctx, next) => {          ctx.state.req = req          console.log(`URL: ${ctx.url}  time: ${timestamp()} request: ${req++}`)          await next()          console.log(`Hit req: ${ctx.state.req}! time: ${timestamp()}`)      })            const router = new Router()            router.get('/', async (ctx, next) => {          ctx.body = {              message: ""Hello, World!""          }          await next()      })            router.get('/favicon.ico', async ctx => ctx )            router.get(""/test"", async ctx => ctx.body = ""Just a test"")            app.use(router.routes())      app.use(async ctx => {          await timeout(10000)          ctx.body.message += ""After the delay!""      })                  app.listen(3000)      console.log(`Listening on port 3000`)      Now this is working perfectly for a single request from a single browser. Problem arises when I try to make a second request to `localhost:3000` from the same browser. The second request doesn't get registered (handled?) until the first request has been completed. This doesn't happen if I make a request to `/test` or use another browser to make the request. The behaviour is consistent for both Chrome and Firefox. Only exception is Firefox Quantum.         Listening on port 3000      URL: /  time: 47:5 request: 0      URL: /  time: 47:7 request: 1      Hit req: 0! time: 47:15      Hit req: 1! time: 47:17      URL: /  time: 47:21 request: 2      Hit req: 2! time: 47:31      URL: /  time: 47:31 request: 3      Hit req: 3! time: 47:41      URL: /  time: 58:14 request: 4      Hit req: 4! time: 58:24      URL: /  time: 58:47 request: 5      URL: /  time: 58:50 request: 6      Hit req: 5! time: 58:57      Hit req: 6! time: 59:0    Here request 0 and 1 are from two different browsers. As you can see, request 1, irrespective of request 0's status. Request 2 and 3 are made from same browser (either Chrome, Firefox or Opera, its same for each of them). Here request 3 only gets registered after the server has finished responding to request 2. Request 4 was an isolated request. Request 5 and 6 are from Firefox Quantum and it behaves as expected.    As per the answer to the [same question on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48568684/need-a-little-help-understanding-node-js-behavior-why-does-a-koa-server-respond), this is happening since I am using `await` in my code. In that case, is this the intended behaviour? Shouldn't koa still respond to the second request irrespective of the first one?  "

__label__question "Extending Fields: rendering field's template without React I'm looking at the [carbon-field-number](https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-field-number) example. The PHP part is clear to me, but I'm confused a little about the JS part.    I see that you use React to render the field's template. But what If I wanted to use a different JS library: Vue.js, Angular... or even plain JS?    I don't really understand based on what the PHP code ""guess"" what JS code is responsible for rendering a field... or the opposite: How the JS script ""knows"" where to render?     I didn't find any information in the [JS API documentation](https://carbonfields.net/docs/advanced-topics-javascript-api/?crb_version=2-1-0) how to wire up the JS code to a specific Field. I guess that a JS module must expose some public API and/or there must be some naming convention that I have to use in order to ""tell"" PHP that ""this JS module is responsible for rendering this carbon field"".    ---  **// edit**    I found that the [bootstrap.js](https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-field-number/blob/master/assets/js/bootstrap.js) is the entry point and it imports the `registerFieldComponent` from `lib/registry`. But what the `lib/registry` module is? I can't find such a module either in the `package.json` nor in the repository.    ...I must have missed something that's really trivial.    **// edit 2**  OK. It seems more clear now when I found this line in the Webpack config:    ``` javascript  /**   * This path assumes that Carbon Fields and the current template   * are both in the `/plugins` directory. Change if according to your needs.   */  const root = path.resolve(__dirname, '../carbon-fields');  ```    the `registerFieldComponent` is meant to be loaded from the carbon fields plugin directory and it seems that we're forced to use React because the `registerFieldComponent` depends on React.     Correct me if I'm wrong."

I'm implementing a force layout graph visualization on top of two.js and [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force). On each tick of the simulation, I'm calling translation.set() for each vertex of the graph to update its position. This is working as expected.

__label__question "StepSequence test case I have a few questions about the test cases for `StepSequence` class, which is related with the design of the class.    (1) In the docstring of the constructor, `_includeEndpoints` means  >If includeEndpoints is true then the final point in the sequence will be the end point, even if it is at less than stepSize from the second to last point.    But in one test case, it seems that `_includeEndpoints` also applies to start point. Because we have  > StepSequence seq(0.55, true);  >  EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(0.0, seq[-1]);    Shall we change to `_includeEndpoint` (no s) and throw a `out_of_range` exception in this case?  An alternative is having both `includeStartpoint` and `includeEndpoint` like in `VanDerCorput` class.    (2) The test for iterator is not fully covered.  There was only `StepSequence seq(0.3, true)` and `StepSequence seq(0.2, false)` is added recently.  The current code will still fail in `StepSequence seq(0.3, false)`.

__label__question Implementing cf-abacus Hi..     I have been trying to implement cf-abacus and have had difficulties just going through the documentation to implement it. It seems a bit dis-joined and/or ambiguous.     We are interested in implementing cf-abacus and would like to contribute back to the community by making the documentation unambiguous. Is there someone who can reach out to me with regard to the same?     I can be reached via email at neville(dot)george(at)gmail(dot)com though I think it can be hashed out via some visual tools
__label__question "What are Individuals and Lindies all about? In [obtheory.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obtheory.txt), all obs, *x*, such that ob.a(*x*) = ob.b(*x*) = *x* are classed as individuals.  `ob.NIL` is established as such an ob, and it is indicated that there can be any number of additional distinct ones.  At the theory, these are distinguished by difference in the lexical forms of the names given to them.      In [obaptheory.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obaptheory.txt), as part of introducing universal functions obap.ap(*p*,*x*) and obap.ev(*exp*), a number of additional individuals  are introduced.  I.e., individuals such as `obap.A`, `obap.C`, `obap.SELF`, and `obap.EV` are identified as distinct primitives along with `ob.NIL`.  In the [reference notation](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/ob.txt) for expression of obs in plaintext, these are designated as `.A`, `.C`, `.SELF`, `.EV`, and `.NIL`, respectively.      Also, in [obaptheory.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obaptheory.txt), we learn that there are lindies (short for literal individuals) that are distinct from primitives and symbolized in the theory by notation Ʃ*s* where *s* is a distinct alphanumeric spelling taken as the identifier of the lindy.  In the reference notation, that lindy is simply written *s*.    Then, in the formulation of the universal function obap.ap in the theory language, *Ot*, there are some elaborate predicates concerning lindies.    What's this all about?"
__label__question "Modified default behavior for negative flux values in spectrum This is an issue just for discussion purposes.    When reading spectra from files, SMHR currently makes all negative values into nan.  For spectra with low S/N, or previously-normalized spectra (e.g. dividing out flats), this removes a lot of pixels that have information but possible bad reductions.    Instead, I have changed this so that it just turns the ivar into a small number but keeps the flux value.  (It is not in v0.2 or on master yet, only in this commit: 1251394f5b19a72640fc4944f233e64aef5464d3.)    @andycasey what do you think?  "

__label__question "Dictionary domainItem reference In FGDC each domain item has a value, definition, and *definition source*.  When I constructed the FGDC reader I did not import the definition source figuring that a single reference (citation) for the whole domain should be sufficient.  Now that I'm writing it back out, I wonder.    The FGDC standard requires a 'definition source' be specified for each enumerated domain item.  If we are strict to the standard we need something to fill the slot.  Looking at the example provided by Dennis I see all definition sources are the same - ""author defined"".      To meet the FGDC standard I could take the `domainReference` and repeat its title in each domain item definition source tag.  This would require FGDC users to create a domain reference that cited the actual author - not just say ""author defined""; but this limits each enumerated domain item to having the same definition  source.     Also, there is no domain level reference in FGDC to harvest by an FGDC reader should someone be making a round trip.  Not a problem if coming from the mdEditor.    Choices:   - [ ] add a domain item reference (citation) so each domain item definition can be separately cited.   - [ ] use the domain reference (citation) title for each domain item when writing FGDC   - [ ] the hybrid - add a domain item reference, make it optional, use the domain reference when the domain item reference is not provided.    - [x] and hybrid 2 - add a domain item reference, make it optional, write in ""author defined"" when the domain item reference is not provided.    - [ ] other ??"

__label__question "Question about ZenPhoto20 I have a few questions about ZenPhoto20.    Currently I use Gallery3 for some years. At that time, I switched from a pure HTML gallery to Gallery3 because I liked it the most. Back then, I also tested JoomGallery, Piwigo, Coppermine and Zenphoto.  What I did not like about Zenphoto was this ""on the fly"" image processing and the cache. It's more neatly designed in Gallery3. What I really need is the tag function. In addition, the URLs in Gallery3 can be tree-structured, without file extension. Unfortunately, Gallery3 went into hibernation a short time later.  I only made a few small core hacks. Mainly I've got the responsive theme working, but only for me, with many adjustments. And I think my photo gallery website is good to find and well visited.    For some days I test ZenPhoto again and come back to the difficulties. Mainly URL, ""on the fly"" and /cache.    I like it more like Gallery3.  /albums  /resize  /thumbs  (possibly for ZenPhoto: backend-thumbs)  And move all images with moving albums/images (in /albums, /resize, /thumbs, ...)    My questions to ZenPhoto20:    1. Does ZenPhoto20 use the ""on the fly"" function to create images?  2. Does ZenPhoto20 use the folder /cache to save the resize images and does ZenPhoto20 save all resize and thumbs in the same subfolder?  I like it more   3. Are these image pages URLs possible in ZenPhoto20?  ```https://www.example.com/album/subalbum/IMG0001```  4. Is it possible to incorporate a responsive basic theme here? (I created one)."

I've followed the conversation on #2810. In which the suggestion was to simply not use a ConcatenatingMediaSource. However, in my use case, the user can toggle whether they want to ""auto play"", and I always want to be able to show the ""next track"" button. This happens to be the same behavior as Youtube.    The only other way I think it could be accomplished, is if I could smoothly (without affecting playback) swap my DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource for a singular MediaSource, and still be able to show the ""next track"" button as enabled. Is that possible?    ### Version of ExoPlayer being used  2.6.1"

__label__question "Random ports and gossip Hello,    I have a question about random ports and gossip protocols. Let's say you use two containers A and B depending on one another and you have a client connecting to A. Using some sort of internal gossip protocol, A will tell the client that he should connect to B using an ip and a port. Problem, those ip and ports are the internal ones from A's point of view and the client will never be able to connect to B.    This sadly happens quite often (kafka+zookeeper, clusters of some sort...)    A more practical example with Kafka and zookeeper:    ```yaml  version: '2'  services:    zookeeper:      image: zookeeper:3.4.10      ports:        - ""2181""      environment:        ZOO_MY_ID: 1    kafka:      image: wurstmeister/kafka:0.10.2.0      depends_on:       - zookeeper      ports:        - ""9092""      environment:        KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 127.0.0.1        KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: ""testtopic1:1:1""        KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper      volumes:        - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  ```    Here the client will connect to Kafka and will never be able to get the correct external port to reach zookeeper. It also happens with the redis cluster image grokzen/redis-cluster.    Basically, do you know a way to cope that situation, configuration wise ? And if not, do you thing there is something you could do within your plugin to solve the issue ?"

__label__question "Question: par_iter slower than shell version; threads not 100% busy If there's a better place to ask this please close and direct me there but this seems like it is a lack of Documentation or a bug.  It could simply be that Rayon's parallelism model is not the right one for my task.    My main problem is that `iter_par` seems to start up with NCPU threads (16) and then eventually  backs off to 3-4 at a time while the rest just sleep.  The same functionality in (quite complex) shell runs in 190 seconds, but 250 seconds in rust (--release).  The code being ran in parallel is _very expensive_ since it does a *fork+exec*.    I've tried `.with_max_len(1)` and other combinations like using `std::usize::MAX` but nothing seems to help.    What I was looking for was a way to have a shared work queue that keeps all threads busy, sending work to the next available thread rather than splitting the work up ""evenly"".  That already sounds like it's not what Rayon is intended for, but with the _work stealing_ feature I figured it should be a decent library for prototyping, but was surprised by the results.    ## Details    I'm also on day 3 of learning Rust.    Using rayon 1.0.0.    ```  let mut portvars: FnvHashMap<&String, FnvHashMap<String, String>> =      FnvHashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher(ports.len(), Default::default());  portvars.par_extend(ports.par_iter().with_max_len(1).map(|port|      (port, port_var_fetch(&config, port, &fetchvars))  ));  ```    Here `ports` is a `Vec<String>` with 26000 items.  I have 16 CPU.    `port_var_fetch` runs `make` to gather variables from _Makefiles_ (on FreeBSD `make -V` can be used for this, I'm not sure what the equivalent in `gmake` is).      ### port_var_fetch    I've listed the `port_var_fetch` in case its implementation is relevant.    This is the `fetchvars` variable that is passed in.  ```  let mut fetchvars = Vec::new();  fetchvars.push((""PKGNAME"", ""PKGNAME""));  fetchvars.push((""MAINTAINER"", ""MAINTAINER""));  fetchvars.push((""FLAVORS"", ""FLAVORS""));  fetchvars.push((""FLAVOR"", ""FLAVOR""));  fetchvars.push((""CATEGORIES"", ""CATEGORIES""));  fetchvars.push((""IGNORE"", ""IGNORE""));  fetchvars.push((""DEPEND_SPECIALS"", ""${_DEPEND_SPECIALS:C,^${PORTSDIR}/,,}""));  fetchvars.push((""SELECTED_OPTIONS"", ""SELECTED_OPTIONS:O""));  fetchvars.push((""LIB_DEPENDS"", ""LIB_DEPENDS""));  fetchvars.push((""RUN_DEPENDS"", ""RUN_DEPENDS""));  ```    ```  fn port_var_fetch(config: &HashMap<String, String>,                    port: &str, vars: &Vec<(&str, &str)>) -> FnvHashMap<String, String> {      let mut args = Vec::with_capacity(vars.len() * 2);      for var in vars {          args.push(""-V"");          args.push(var.1);      }      let results = pmake(&config, port, args);      let mut result: FnvHashMap<String, String> =          FnvHashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher(vars.len(), Default::default());      result.extend(vars.into_iter().zip(results.lines())          .map(|(var, value)| ((*var).0.into(), value.into())));      result  }    fn pmake(config: &HashMap<String, String>,           origin: &str, args: Vec<&str>) -> String {      make(&(config.get(""PORTSDIR"").unwrap().to_string() + ""/"" + origin), args)  }    fn make(dir: &str, args: Vec<&str>) -> String {      let mut cmd = Command::new(""/usr/bin/make"");      cmd.stdin(Stdio::inherit())          .stderr(Stdio::inherit())          .arg(""-C"").arg(dir)          .args(args);      let output = cmd.output().expect(""Make failed"");      String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).trim().to_string()  }  ```"

__label__question "How to use ChakraCore Debug API Hi.    Once the JsDiagStartDebugging call is  done with a certain callback, and a call to [JSRun](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/JsRun) is in the process of the provided code, the provided callback is called with the event JsDiagDebugEventSourceCompile.  That's ok.  But the code provided to JSRun is always runned before taking into account any call to JsDiagSetBreakpoint, or JsDiagRequestAsyncBreak, even if these functions are called inside the callback, or called before JSRun.    And so I always end with the JsErrorDiagNotAtBreak error code.  Furthermore with more complex code, any ""echo"" in the JS code is done (and visible in the console) when the call to [JSRun](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/JsRun) is completed. So anything done after the [JSRun](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/JsRun) completion seems to be useless as the JS code will be executed.

This is a known issue that was fixed in boost 1.62.    As far as I know the only known fix is to upgrade to boost 1.62 or higher.  The code all works fine.      The question is whether it is worth upgrading travis to 1.62 or higher to get rid of the warnings.  Costs are that 1.61 is the lowest boost version we support that compiles everything.  so we would loose the earliest supported platform if we upgrade.     "

The urls for many of these files are given by sourceURL in the module metadata -- presumably those should be used by the module for downloading so that the developers don't need to change urls in multiple places.  >   > As is, `prepInputs` circumvents `downloadData`. I understand it's doing more than simply downloading, but it's using an entirely different mechanism for the download part [`downloadFromWebDB`]. At the very least we can try to be consistent in where those to download mechanisms get their data.    As I see it there is a disconnect between these two download mechanisms. I feel they should both use the same mechanism for downloads to ensure that a user always gets the same result.  _Copied from original issue: PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools#16_"

[...] --> _maybe different collections? so each server can handle its own? Would need to implement kind of a ""proxy"" in the API but seems better for performance, doesn't it?_  2. Create a way for the server to pause jobs if the CPU usage is high. Every little bit helps, right?  --> _i would implement this after 5, just to allow to run important jobs in any case_  3. Create a way to run jobs as a microservice. --> _maybe that would be another project that uses this package and adds a REST API?_  4. Create a way to repeat jobs. (Perhaps this should be another package?) --> _as there are many formats to represent schedules and repetitions, I would go with different packages, yep_ :+1:   5. Create a way to prioritize certain jobs --> _nothing to add here :)_  6. Add support for hooks --> _nothing to add here neither :)_  7. Add Jobs.delay() to delaying tasks --> _maybe a field in the job object? a Jobs.delay() to delay all jobs and a Jobs.delay(jobId), Jobs.delay(priorityLevel), ... also related to 5?_  8. Add support for setting manual timezones on jobs --> _using momentJS should be ""easy"", isn't it?_    bonus track:    9. Add a template you can use as UI in a project's admin are (control job queue, jobs and get execution logs) --> this would totally be another package :)  10. Add some basic functions like: `Jobs.isStarted()` and `Jobs.getStats()` or just a `Jobs.getStatus()` for getting if the queue is stopped/started and jobs pending/failed/succeeded/canceled/running. This would be related to 1 and 5.    I'm totally interested in 4 and quite interested in 7 and 8. Also in 9 and 10 logically. I can put some spare time in this too :)"

I am working on the ARIA attribute-reflection branch for Issue #691. I attempted to define the “Role” interface in IDL with a single “role” attribute. However, this is either an IDL error or it’s a ReSpec parsing bug that does not allow the interface name and attribute name to be the same. If you use the <dfn> elements as expected, there is a case-insensitive match, and ReSpec throws an error that you’re defining the interface or attribute twice.  ```  interface mixin Role {      attribute DOMString? role;  };  Element includes Role;  ```  If I change the interface name, it works.

__label__question "Execute-ProcessAsUser Looking for guidance in order to execute a simple Powershell script under the Users context - I have two scenarios that I've tested, one works and the other doesn't.     1.

I would like to request either documentation on how to do this, if currently possible, or for the feature to be implemented into core.    The use case for this is loading spinners.     We want a loading spinner to show for a minimum of ~ 600ms to signify something is happening in the application, Currently a request takes ~ 200ms which is too short for a UI change to not look broken, but we cannot guarantee that it will always be that quick, so a loading spinner is necessary  Expected result: minimumTime: 1000 would say that a request that takes ~200ms will wait an additional ~800ms before response happens.

__label__question "Reduce subspace of iterative EOF routine EOF unit test is failing (at least for me).  In the end, I'm getting the message:  > ValueError: On entry to DLASCL parameter number 4 had an illegal value  and all my eigenvalues are zero.  Traced the issue to the size of the subspace used.  We solve for more eigenvalues than necessary, in the hopes that we'll be more well separated from the uncomputed eigenvalues (and thus, converge faster with the power method).  The formula used to compute the subspace is:  ``` python subspace = 2*num + 8 ```  which means, even for computing a single eigenvector in the test script we need to keep track of the top 10 eigenvectors, and solve 10x10 covariance matrices. Even worse is for the `EOF_guess` stage, where we concatenate two sets of eigenvectors together to solve for ""merged"" eigenvectors.  This doubles (quadruples?) the covariance to 20x20, which (for the test data) is pushing us beyond the capacity of lapack.  We're getting negative eigenvalues for some of the smaller components, which get translated to NaNs later on and ultimately screws up the entire solver.  The safest thing would be to set the subspace equal to the actual space we're interested in by default, and not pad it with extra entries that might not be numerically resolvable.  The trade-off is this could slow down convergence, though.  However, you could always pass an explicit `subspace` value directly to `EOF_iter` and speed things up when it's safe to do so.  Any thoughts on changing the default subspace?  Has this been an issue for anyone else? "

Of course we have a database with test data for our development environment. But (as it's usual in development) not 100% of the edge cases are covered in that database.    These cases would have been easily avoidable by having some kind of test framework that developers could adopt to actually test their database migrations.    **Possible Solution**  A possible solution would be a database e2e testing framework where developers could could configure:  1. An in-memory database and how the model looks like before the migration is executed  2. The `node-db-migrate` migration that needs to be executed  3. A `mocha.js` (https://mochajs.org/) file which will execute the JS tests    So the testing framework would check multiple scenarios (with the defined in-memory database) and then check the results with the mocha.js tests.    This issue is more an open discussion than really a feature request. I'm interest in opinions if `node-db-migrate` should cover such a testing framework."

__label__question "Chips added with custom chipRendered added below I am using the next version that is being ported to Material-ui 1.0.0 beta. I noticed that when I pass a chipRenderer, the new chips are being added below the existing instead of on the same line as the existing. If the remove the chipRenderer then the chip are added on the same line.   Any suggestions?    Furthermore, the reason I am using a chipRenderer is because without it, the ChipInput in creating Basic Chips i.e. without the (X) delete. So by added a chipRenderer and specifying a 'onRequestDelete' function, I get Chips with (X).  Thanks."

__label__question "Differences between variable name and out_name In the `01.00.15` version of the MIP tables, there are a number of variables that have an `out_name` that differs from the variable name, but the variable `out_name` already exists in the MIP table. See, for example, [ua in CMIP6_6hrPlevPt.json](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/blob/master/Tables/CMIP6_6hrPlevPt.json#L484) and [ua7h in CMIP6_6hrPlevPt.json](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/blob/master/Tables/CMIP6_6hrPlevPt.json#L502), which has an `out_name` of `ua`.    This means, once `cmor.setup` and `cmor.dataset_json` have been run, if someone tries to produce `ua` from `6hrPlevPt`, then `ua7h` from `6hrPlevPt`, wouldn't the corresponding filename of the output netCDF file be the same?

__label__question "Request to add slotDetails to AWS.LexRuntime.postText() and postContent() response According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/built-in-slot-time.html:    >Amazon Lex uses the slotDetails attribute of a Lambda event to pass resolutions for the ambiguous times to your Lambda function. For example, if your bot prompts the user for a delivery time, the user can respond by saying ""10 o'clock."" This time is ambiguous. It means either 10:00 AM or 10:00 PM. In this case, the value in the slots map is null, and the slotDetails entity contains the two possible resolutions of the time.

__label__question "vapp property changing restarts the VM, can it work like a null provider? Hi there,    Regarding the new vapp features introduced in #303 , I want to ask if there   is any reason why it’s changes are tracked and require real changes?    Both coreos cloud-init  and the general cloud-init are bootstrapping tools.    They are not used to introduce changes in an ongoing manner.    However, terraform still allows newer resources by changing the count parameter.  What if, ones usecase is to introduce some improvements in new server’s ignition config,  but handle configuration management on old servers out of band (with respect to terraform)?    I think it might be the more appropriate default setting for vapp properties to not trigger changes. If not by default, maybe users can specify whether they would like changes in their vapp properties to trigger real changes on existing resources. Just throwing some ideas there.    I always like how the null provider deals with changes. I have to explicitly taint and apply them. In vapp changes as I see them applying currently, restarting the VM may not be good for maintaining quorums of etcd, consul or zookeeper clusters.    Thoughts?    ### Affected Resource(s)    Please list the resources as a list, for example:  - `vsphere_virtual_machine`  "

__label__question "Clarify end-to-end story for heatmap-scatterplots I wanted to clarify the end-to-end user story, from experimental data coming in to Refinery, to starting a heatmap-scatterplot (and other visualizations down the line). Right now there's a little confusion about how to relate the columns of the CSV to the metadata.    @ngehlenborg : Can you say which of these is best? (I started with 4, but now think 1 is most likely to work. Or maybe 3.)    ## scheme 1: vis input is multiple two-column CSVs.    Instead of taking a single CSV as input, there are multiple CSVs, each with just two columns: IDs and values. The machinery to merge these is already in place, and since Refinery metadata is file-based, we'll be able to connect the two.    ## scheme 2: vis input is one multi-column CSV, metadata from refinery    Right now, metadata is per-file, and there's no necessary relationship between the columns of the csv and the metadata that Refinery knows about. Both would need to change... perhaps there's a preparatory workflow that would need to be run?    ## scheme 3: vis input is one multi-column CSV, metadata from separate file    This was the impression I got at the meeting with core... but it's not Refinery-ish: The metadata should be refinery-metadata, not simply another data file. On the other hand, the route forward here is more clear than it is for other scenarios.    ## scheme 4: vis input is one multi-column CSV, metadata from headers    I think this is where I was initially heading, but it doesn't match the data core currently provides, and it might make parsing harder. (ie, How do I know when I'm past the metadata rows/columns?)"

I am trying to understand the implication of both.

Is that correct? "

__label__question "MasterElement inconsistency: `general_shape_fcn` not implemented for Wedge, Pyramids etc The `general_shape_fcn` is only implemented for HEX in 3-D but not for other topologies. Instead there are `wedge_shape_fcn`, `pyr_shape_fcn` etc. This causes issues for overset in [overset assemble](https://github.com/NaluCFD/Nalu/blob/master/src/overset/AssembleOversetSolverConstaintAlgorithm.C#L175) when used with mixed topologies. I am able to work around this temporarily by the code snippet below (wedge for example).    ```  +  void general_shape_fcn(  +    const int npts,  +    const double *par_coord,  +    double* shape_fcn)  +  { wedge_shape_fcn(npts, par_coord, shape_fcn); }  +  ```    However, I am unsure of the reasons behind this. Was this just an oversight, or is there a specific reason why the code defines `wedge_shape_fcn` instead of overriding `general_shape_fcn`? "

__label__question "suggestions 1) add the sorting of websites via site url, not just the site title.  That way when you sort it all the imdb.com are next to one another, all of the youtube.com's are next to one another, etc.      2) add a X button to delete a webpage, this will make management a lot faster.  Not a submenu like right click, but an actual button that appears when hovering over.  or at the very least when you hold down a button like shift, or control, that way you can manage old tabs not needed MUCH faster.  This feature is in almost all the other tab manager programs, this would be a great addition.    3) allow the top utility area to follow when scrolling down.  Especially the search field.  that way you don't have to scroll all the way back up to modify your search parameters or interact with any other button currently at the top.    4)  allow apple-f (command-f) to populate the search field for real quick searching instead of scrolling to the top manually either via scroll wheel or clicking on the bar.  this would be lessened with the suggestion #3, but it still would be also more helpful and fluid if you added this feature.      5)  with the slowness of removing tabs no longer needed, either opening them in a tab then closing that tab (slow) or manually clicking on the small box, then scrolling to the top and clicking deleted checked (almost worse), one way that may allow for another smoother way to manage would be the ability to highlight them like you would in finder, with perhaps shift or command/control, forming the group of ones you don't want then you can delete them with the button.  Even at this point adding a right click menu item of ""remove all tabs selected?"" would be helpful so not needing to scroll to the top.  On top of this suggestion, a slightly different way to do this, would be to allow arrow scrolling up and down, and allowing space bar to check/uncheck the boxes, once again to allow faster managing.  we are wrangling tabs here, and that can get into the 100's of tabs, so anything that cuts down movements and seconds, helps heaps.      I would love to say, thank you for this addon.  it is great.  Fantastic way to manage.  I hope you will look into adding this to safari and firefox.  Especially safari, it does not have anything even remotely good enough.  Firefox has decent alternatives, but man safari is lacking, probably due to having to get official certificate via apple developer, but hey, just make it github and we can install in a round about way.  Please please add these ideas as well as make a safari counterpart.  This way of managing tabs is vastly superior to others at the moment.  "

__label__question "Dynamically requiring components / require.context Is there a way to dynamically require a component in an example?    My use case is building a gallery of all of our icons, which are all SVG files transformed into React components at load time using `svg-loader`.   We have a lot of icons, so I'd like to avoid having to manually require them for the gallery - it's also an extra build step that's easily forgotten when adding icons to our styleguide.    This works in examples, but requires manual work for each new icon:    ```jsx  const icons = {      iconA: require('./icons/IconA.svg'),      iconB: require('./icons/IconB.svg'),      //...,      iconZ: require('./icons/IconZ.svg')  }    <IconGallery icons={icons} />  ```    Downside is manually adding the icon + require to each example.  The following would be a small improvement, but doesn't seem possible unless I'm doing it wrong - I get an error message that `require with expressions is not supported`:    ```jsx  const iconNames = ['iconA', 'iconB', /* ... */ 'iconZ'];  const icons = iconNames.reduce((icons, name) => {      icons[name] = require('./icons/' + name + '.svg');      return icons;  }, {});    <IconGallery icons={icons} />  ```    If I were building this in straight webpack, I would do something like this -- and this would be my preference since icons can just be added by dropping them in the right folder without editing the styleguide.  But I get the error that `require.context is not a function`:    ```jsx  const iconsContext = require.context('./icons/', true, /svg$/);  const icons = iconsContext.keys().reduce( (icons, file) => {  	const SVG = iconContext(file).default;  	const label = file.slice(2, -4); // strip './' and '.svg'  	icons[label] = SVG;          return icons;  }, {});    <IconGallery icons={icons} />  ```    Given the error messages I'm getting, it seems this is not possible... but I thought I'd ask in case there's a feature or configuration I'm missing.  Alternatively, any pointers for where I could look if I wanted to try to try my hand at adding this?"
__label__question "Extend sample code to have a good counter example Hi Guys,    I have troubles with creating sample code that generates a good and clear counter example. In my previous post we came to the conclusion that possibly the sample was to short to generate a good counter example, by disabling the optimizations we were able to get it correct.    I have tried several ways to increase the sample code, but none gave me a correct counter example with the optimizations enabled. With your experience, what would be a good extension to the following code snippet to get a good counter example?    my complete code as sample:    `extern int nd(void);  extern void __VERIFIER_error(void) __attribute__((noreturn));  #define assert(X) if(!(X)){__VERIFIER_error();}    extern int ValidateFunc(void);  extern int ValidateVal(void);  extern int nd ();  #define N 10  int a[N];    int addafter(int x, int y) {    return x+y;  }    int display()  {     int x=addafter(1,1); int y=3;   if(ValidateFunc()==10) {     int t1 = x;     int t2 = y;     x = t1+ t2;     y = t1 + t2;    }     assert(y == 3);       return 0;  }    int main() {    if(ValidateVal())    {      display();    }      int i;    for (i=0;i<N;i++)    {      if (nd ())        a[i] = N;    }      return 0;  }`    with the current code I always get the following counter example:  `@0 = private constant [1 x i32] zeroinitializer  @1 = private global i32 0  @2 = private constant [1 x i32] zeroinitializer  @3 = private global i32 0`    Where the expected values are not there (zeroinitializer).

__label__question "Should we use shippable for testing? Well,  While dockerhub gives us the errors in building, it doesn't test the programs with real data. For that a CI would be nice and the only one that I've found really compatible with docker is  [shippable](https://app.shippable.com/).  With shippable we can define the image to pull and create a yml file (just like all CIs) with commands to run on it.  This means we can have an automatic build from github and have shippable download a dataset and run the container on it.  Furthermore, shippable can pull the git, build the image, run the test and, it the container pass, submit the built container to dockerhub.  The disadvantage of the latter is that shippable requires the Dockerfile to be in the root of the git repository. May be in the future they change it.  What do you think? Should we advise for the usage of shippable and the creation of datasets for testing?  /cc @BioDocker/contributors  "

__label__question "Custom Logger / No longer use bind Is there a way to inject a custom logger (server) into rollbar.js? If not, how would we best support this?    The problem with the current [logger.js](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar.js/blob/master/src/server/logger.js) is that we can't inject into the console since it uses bind.    So the option for my use case is either (1) use `function (...args) { console.log(...args); }` (PR) or (2) somehow inject a custom logger (which could then do that).    Suggestions?    *Use Case:*  I need to capture all console output for automatic analysis in testing. With the current rollbar setup the generic catch all fails since it uses `bind`."

I have video content and advertisement content (ad xml and ad video) in my local intranet.

If I enable internet access to this wifi connection and try to run this application then ads in my local intranet are playing fine.    But If I disable internet access to this local intranet wifi and try to run this application then my ads (which is in local intranet) keep on buffering and not playing at all.  When I try to fiddler my mobile traffic I see that IMA sdk tries to request below urls to play ads.    https://imasdk.googleapis.com  https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com    So my question is ""Does internet access is necessary to play advertisement using IMA sdk?"".
