# Open Source Network Metrics Prediction

### Research Background
In the development of Open Source Software (OSS), the behavior data of developers exhibit complex correlational and cyclical characteristics, which are crucial for understanding developers' behavior patterns, project progress, and the impact on software quality. However, these complex characteristics make it challenging to accurately predict and analyze developer behaviors using traditional statistical methods, hence the emergence of network metrics for assessing open source software. Nonetheless, open source operators are more inclined to enhance network metrics through statistical indicators, making it vital to build a predictive model that adapts to the OSS data characteristics and can fit both network and statistical indicators.

### Task Description
How can a predictive model be built that fits network metrics with statistical indicators? This model needs to adapt to the characteristics of OSS data, including the complex correlations among various behavioral data and the cyclicity of developer behavior. The fitting algorithm also needs to have a certain level of interpretability.

### Task Challenges
Cyclicality: Developer behavior data often shows cyclicality, for example, developers might write more code on weekdays and less on weekends. This cyclical characteristic needs to be captured and considered by the predictive model.
Interpretability: To understand which statistical indicators are more important for the prediction outcome, the predictive model needs to have a certain level of interpretability, posing challenges for the modelâ€™s design and selection.
Dynamism: The development of OSS projects is dynamic, and the behavior patterns of developers, the scale of the project, and the quality of the software can change over time. Therefore, the predictive model needs to be able to adapt to this dynamism for real-time or near-real-time prediction.
