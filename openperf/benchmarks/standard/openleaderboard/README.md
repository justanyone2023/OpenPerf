# OpenLeaderboard Rankings
Benchmarking is a measurable industry best level of performance, used as a reference scale; it recognizes performance levels as standards of excellence in specific areas. Essentially, the purpose of such benchmark testing is to learn from the benchmarks.
In the open-source digital ecosystem, this can include benchmark open-source projects, benchmark open-source developers, and benchmark open-source companies, i.e., entities that possess measurable, industry-leading open-source achievements or recognized performance levels that serve as standards of excellence in their respective fields.
[OpenLeaderBoard](https://open-leaderboard.x-lab.info/) was officially launched at the North American Open Source Summit in June 2022. This project aims to provide insights into the open-source world, helping users easily access a series of information about open-source projects. It allows users not only to see the rankings and popularity of projects but also to understand the contributions and positions of related companies in the open-source field, as shown in the figure below.
The leaderboard utilizes indices such as influence and activity from OpenPerf, and these benchmarks are defined and produce final data through tasks such as "Open Source Project Influence Rankings," while ranking the top entities (e.g., Top 100) as benchmark sets.
Currently, OpenLeaderboard has become a weathervane in the software industry's open-source domain. It has been well applied in areas including open-source component selection, analysis of international open-source situations, and observation of enterprises with open-source communities. The project primarily uses the activity and influence benchmarks from OpenPerf to rank open-source projects, not only helping users understand the trends of open-source projects but also establishing industry benchmarks, further promoting the development of open-source projects.
